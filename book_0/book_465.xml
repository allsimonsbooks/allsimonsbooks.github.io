      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September
      2011</strong>
        : Erin Morgenstern’s dark, enchanting
      debut takes us to the black and white tents of
        <em>Le Cirque des Reves</em>
        , a circus that arrives without
      warning, simply appearing when yesterday it was not there.
      Young Celia and Marco have been cast into a rivalry at
        <em>The Night Circus</em>
        , one arranged long ago by powers
      they do not fully understand. Over time, their lives become
      more intricately enmeshed in a dance of love, joy, deceit,
      heartbreak, and magic. Author Morgenstern knows her world
      inside and out, and she guides the reader with a confident
      hand. The setting and tone are never less than mesmerizing.
      The characters are well-realized and memorable. But it is the
      Night Circus itself that might be the most memorable of all.

        Praise for THE NIGHT CIRCUS:

      <p>
        "
        <em>The Night Circus</em>
        made me happy. Playful and
      intensely imaginative, Erin Morgenstern has created the
      circus I have always longed for and she has populated it with
      dueling love-struck magicians, precocious kittens,
      hyper-elegant displays of beauty and complicated clocks. This
      is a marvelous book."

        "Debut author Morgenstern doesn't miss a beat in this
      smashing tale of greed, fate, and love...a giant, magical
      story destined for bestsellerdom. This is an electric debut
      on par with
        <em>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</em>
        ."

          "Self-assured, entertaining debut that blends genres
        and crosses continents in quest of magic... Generous in its
        vision and fun to read. Likely to be a big book—and,
        soon, a big movie, with all the franchise trimmings."

            "This big and compelling first novel ushers in a
      menacing tone with its first sentence: "The circus arrives
      without warning."...With appeal for readers not particularly
      geared to fantasy but who plainly enjoy an unusual and
      well-drawn story, this one will make a good crossover
      suggestion."

            “‘Dark as soot and bright as sparks,’
            <em>The Night Circus</em>
            still holds me willingly captive in
      a world of almost unbearable beauty. This is a love story on
      a grand scale: it creates, it destroys, it ultimately
      transcends. Take a bow, Erin Morgenstern. This is one of the
      best books I have ever read.”
