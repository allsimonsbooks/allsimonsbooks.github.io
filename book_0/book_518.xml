      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 4 in the Belgariad series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">END OF THE QUEST</p>
    <p xmlns="">It had all begun with the theft of the Orb that had so long
    protected the West from the evil God Torak. Before that, Garion
    had been a simple farm boy. Afterward, he discovered that his
    aunt was really the Sorceress Polgara and his grandfather was
    Belgarath, the Eternal Man. Then, on the long quest to recover
    the Orb, Garion found to his dismay that he, too, was a
    sorcerer.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Now, at last, the Orb was regained and the quest was nearing
    its end. Of course, the questors still had to escape from this
    crumbling enemy fortress and flee across a desert filled with
    Murgo soldiers searching for them, while Grolim Hierarchs
    strove to destroy them with dark magic. Then, somehow, they
    must manage to be in Riva with the Orb by Erastide. After that,
    however, Garion was sure that his part in these great events
    would be finished.</p>
    <p xmlns="">But the Prophecy still held future surprises for Garion--and
    for the little princess Ce'Nedra.</p>
    <p xmlns="">This continues the magnificent epic of The
    Belgariad,  begun in Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of
    Sorcery, and Magician's Gambit--a fantasy set against a
    background of the war of men, Kings, and Gods that had spanned
    seven thousand years--a novel of fate, strange lands, and a
    prophecy that must be fulfilled!  </p>
