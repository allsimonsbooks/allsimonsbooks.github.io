      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">EDITORIAL REVIEW: The acclaimed *Farseer* and *Liveship
    Traders* trilogies established Robin Hobb as one of the most
    splendidly imaginative practitioners of world-class fantasy.
    Now, in Book 2 of her most stunning trilogy yet, Hobb continues
    the soul-shattering tale of FitzChivalry Farseer. With rich
    characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, **Golden
    Fool** brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in
    an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.**Golden
    Fool**Prince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald
    kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But
    for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible.
    Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz
    must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as
    Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock,
    bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and
    ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly,
    Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide
    a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.The problems
    are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska
    Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the
    Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets.
    Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of
    the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the
    Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the
    Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread
    “beast magic.”Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart
    to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the
    hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process,
    they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful
    talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous
    consequences for all.Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with
    the Fool brings him any solace. But even that is shattered when
    unexpected visitors from Bingtown reveal devastating secrets
    from the Fool’s past. Now, bereft of support and adrift
    in intrigue, Fitz’s biggest challenge may be simply to
    survive the inescapable and violent path that fate has laid out
    for him.*From the Hardcover edition.*</p>
