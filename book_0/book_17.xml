      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 7 in the Series of Unfortunate Events series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      The seventh book in Lemony Snicket's splendidly gloomy
    Series of Unfortunate Events shadows the three Baudelaire
    orphans as they plummet headlong into their next misadventure.
    Mr. Poe, their ineffective legal guardian, having exhausted all
    options for finding them a new home with relatives (including
    their 19th cousin), sadly entrusts his young charges' fate to a
    progressive guardian program formed with the premise "It takes
    a village to raise a child." Before they know it, the
    Baudelaires are being whisked off on a bus to a village (vile)
    named "V.F.D." Snicket fans who read
      <i>The Austere Academy</i>
      and
      <i>The Ersatz Elevator</i>
      will jump to see these three
    initials, as they provide a clue to the tragic disappearance of
    the Baudelaires' friends, the beloved, equally orphaned
    Quagmire triplets.
      <p>
        To the orphans' dismay, V.F.D. is covered in crows--so much
    so that the whole village is pitch-black and trembling. "The
    crows weren't squawking or cawing, which is what crows often
    do, or playing the trumpet, which crows practically never do,
    but the town was far from silent. The air was filled with the
    sounds the crows made as they moved around." Another disturbing
    element of the town is that the Council of Elders (who wear
    creepy crow hats) has thousands of rules, such as "don't hurt
    crows" and "don't build mechanical devices." Fortunately, the
    Baudelaires are taken in by a kindly handyman named Hector who
    cooks them delicious Mexican food and secretly breaks rules.
    Still, neither Hector nor an entire village can protect the
    orphans from the clutches of the money-grubbing Count Olaf, who
    has relentlessly pursued them (actually, just their fortune)
    since
        <i>The Bad Beginning</i>
        . Fans won't want to miss any of this
    marvelously morbid series! (Ages 9 and older)
