        John Shannow, The Jerusalem Man, lived in a world that had
      toppled on its axis. Civilization had been replaced by
      ruthlessness and savagery. Relentless in his quest for peace,
      Shannow followed a path that led only to bloodshed and
      sorrow.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Abaddon, the Lord of the Pit, sought to plunge mankind
      into a new Satanic era. His Hellborn army spewed forth from
      the Plague Lands with an unholy force stemming from human
      sacrifice. For it was the blood of innocents that fueled the
      corrupted Sipstrassi Stones of Power--the source of Abaddon's
      might.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>But the Hellborn made a fatal mistake--they took the woman
      who had stolen Shannow's heart. He would move Heaven and
      Earth to save her or he would die trying.</p>
      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>'Has pace, conviction and gritty resolute vitality...The
      result is a book that will be enjoyed by Tolkien fans' TIMES
      EDUCATIONAL SUPPLEMENT</p>
      <h3>From the Publisher</h3>
      <p>
        Wolf in Shadow by David Gemmell
        <br />
        David Gemmel is a very tall, debonair Brit. I met him
      at WorldCon in San Antonio and we talked for over an hour
      about how an author brings passion into his writing. David
      believes that he's gotten it right when he can read his own
      work and a charater's plight moves him to tears or anger,
      when he can feel the character's pain as if it were his own.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I can testify that his passion gushes from his works which
      are action-packed and charged with high emotions. His books
      top the best-seller lists in Great Britain and David receives
      a lot of fan mail. In fact, he had decided to end the John
      Shannow tales but a flood of readers' letters kept demanding
      more, and he changed his mind. I guess he appreciates the
      passion in his fans' letters, too!
