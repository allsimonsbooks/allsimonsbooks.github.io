        The most anticipated book in Stephen King's legendary
      career, The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower is the final
      installment to the bestselling author's epic series-a story
      that began thirty-three years ago with The Gunslinger and has
      gathered millions of ardent fans since Donald M. Grant
      published a limited edition of that first volume in 1981.
        <br />
        <br />
        This volume completes the quest of Roland Deschain, the
      last gunslinger in a world which has "moved on." Like the
      first book in the series, the last is beautifully illustrated
      by famed fantasy artist Michael Whelan. And with the same mix
      of triumph and loss that made Wolves of the Calla a runaway
      bestseller, The Dark Tower tracks Roland towards his ultimate
      goal, the tower itself-the center of all time, all place. But
      this time, as Roland's ka-tet moves through The Dixie Pig in
      New York City to Algul Siento in End-World, the losses come
      from within his circle of companions. His antagonists, from
      Mia's chap Mordred to the force of evil known as the Crimson
      King, grow more desperate. In the final stage of his search,
      Roland needs one more ally, a last key to gain entry to the
      tower. What awaits him there, at the tower's very top, is a
      mystery sure to awe King's legions of devoted fans.
        <br />
        <br />
        With Stephen King's unparalleled storytelling power,
      and with interest in fantasy at an all-time high, the release
      of The Dark Tower will be the most exciting publishing event
      of the year.
