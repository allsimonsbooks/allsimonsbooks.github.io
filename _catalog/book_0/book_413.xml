      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 1 in the First Formic War series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        A hundred years before Orson Scott Card's
        <em>Ender's Game</em>
        , humans thought they were alone in the
      galaxy. Humanity was slowly making their way out from
      Earth to the planets and asteroids of the Solar System,
      exploring and mining and founding colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mining ship
        <em>El Cavador</em>
        is far out from Earth, in the deeps of
      the Kuiper Belt, beyond Pluto. Other mining ships, and
      the families that live on them, are few and far between this
      far out. So when
        <em>El Cavador</em>
        ’s telescopes pick up a fast-moving
      object coming in-system, it’s hard to know what to make
      of it. It’s massive and moving at a significant
      fraction of the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>But the ship has other problems. Their systems
      are old and failing. The family is getting too
      big. There are claim-jumping corporates bringing
      Asteroid Belt tactics to the Kuiper Belt. Worrying about
      a distant object that might or might not be an alien ship
      seems…not important.</p>
      <p>They're wrong. It's the most important thing that has
      happened to the human race in a million years. This is
      humanity's first contact with an alien race. The First Formic
      War is about to begin.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Earth Unaware</em>
        is the first novel in The First Formic
      War series by Orson Scott Card and Aaron Johnston.
