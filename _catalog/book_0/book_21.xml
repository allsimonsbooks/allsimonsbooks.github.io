      Book 4 in the Series of Unfortunate Events series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Mr Poe delivers the three Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus
    and little Sunny, to their new guardian, the owner of the Lucky
    Smells Lumbermill in Paltryville. But far from living in the
    mill, they rapidly discover they will be working there and even
    worse, there is a book in the library by a Dr Orwell,
    sinisterly shaped like Count Olaf's eye tattoo. Each morning
    Foreman Flacutono wakes the workers by banging metal pots
    together and directs them through a day of arduous logscraping,
    with only chewing gum for lunch and damp casserole for dinner.
    Their guardian, a terrifying man with a cloud of smoke where
    his head should be, known only as 'Sir', proposes
    unsatisfactorily that if they work in his mill, he'll 'try' to
    keep Count Olaf away. Klaus trips over Foreman Flacutono's
    strategically placed foot and his glasses get broken. He
    returns from the village eye doctor, none other than Dr Orwell,
    strangely changed. Violet believes Klaus has been hypnotised,
    and when they discover Dr Orwell's receptionist, Shirley, is
    really Count Olaf dressed horribly, her worst fears are
    confirmed. Dr Orwell herself becomes the victim of the nasty
    accident at the lumbermill she, Foreman Flacutono and Shirley
    have arranged. Sir decides to pack the children off to their
    next dismal adventure at The Austere Academy.</p>
