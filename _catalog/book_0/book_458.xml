      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 3 in the Harry Potter series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <h3 xmlns="">Amazon.com Review</h3>
    <p xmlns="">For most children, summer vacation is something to look
    forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to
    spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest
    him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's</p>
    <p xmlns="">
      As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant
    wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle
    neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently
    purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly
    inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he
    begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials
    let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped
    convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only
    that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the
    Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very
    heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has
    created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering,
    not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately,
    there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older)

    <h3 xmlns="">From Publishers Weekly</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      Rowling proves that she has plenty of tricks left up her
    sleeve in this third Harry Potter adventure, set once again at
    the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Right before
    the start of term, a supremely dangerous criminal breaks out of
    a supposedly impregnable wizards' prison; it will come as no
    surprise to Potter fans that the villain, a henchman of Harry's
    old enemy Lord Voldemort, appears to have targeted Harry. In
    many ways this installment seems to serve a transitional role
    in the seven-volume series: while many of the adventures are
    breathlessly relayed, they appear to be laying groundwork for
    even more exciting adventures to come. The beauty here lies in
    the genius of Rowling's plotting. Seemingly minor details
    established in books one and two unfold to take on unforeseen
    significance, and the finale, while not airtight in its
    internal logic, is utterly thrilling. Rowling's wit never
    flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world
    (Just how would a magician be made to stay behind bars?) or
    tossing off quick jokes (a grandmother wears a hat decorated
    with a stuffed vulture; the divination classroom looks like a
    tawdry tea shop). The Potter spell is holding strong. All ages.
