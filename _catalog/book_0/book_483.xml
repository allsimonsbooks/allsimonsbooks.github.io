      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>Eight hundred years have passed since King Connavar of the
      Rigante and his bastard son, Bane, defeated the invading army
      of Stone. Now the Rigante have lost the freedom and culture
      so many gave their lives to preserve. Only one woman remains
      who follows the ancient ways–the Wyrd of Wishing Tree
      Wood–and she alone knows the nature of the evil soon to
      be unleashed. But the Wyrd pins her hope on two men: a giant
      Rigante fighter, a man haunted by his failure to save his
      best friend from betrayal; and a youth whose deadly talents
      will earn him the rancor of the brutal Varlish. One will
      become the Ravenheart, an outlaw leader whose daring exploits
      will inspire the Rigante. The other will forge a
      legend–and light the fires of revolution. . . .</p>
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>The third book in Gemmell's popular heroic fantasy saga,
      the Rigante series (The Sword in the Storm; Midnight Falcon),
      puts a host of characters through a load of action without
      much resolution. Centuries ago, after the capture of the
      Rigante hero, Connavar, Varlish troops subjugated the Rigante
      highlanders. In recent times the great-hearted warrior Jaim
      Grymauch promised to care for the infant son of his best
      friend, Lanovar, who was betrayed by the local lord, the
      Moidart. Now with Lanovar's son, Kaelin Ring, on the verge of
      manhood, the highlanders once again chafe under the Moidart's
      rule. While even the Moidart's son, Gaise Macon, can see the
      injustice in the situation, he has little influence over his
      single-minded father. Then the rape and murder of a young
      Varlish woman stirs up violence and raises questions. Kaelin
      and Jaim find the murderer with the help of the sorceress
      known as the Wyrd of Wishing Tree woods, but when Kaelin
      gives in to his bloodlust and kills the criminal, his aunt
      Maev sends him away to distant Black Mountain, near the
      mighty Rigante clan lord Call Jace. As each man accepts the
      fate laid out for him by the Wyrd, it's hard not to notice
      how Gemmell seems more intent on setting up the plot for his
      next book than on telling a balanced story. Plenty of loose
      ends most notably the future of Gaise clamor for expansion,
      but this novel seems mostly to be a place-keeper in the
      series.</p>

      <h3>From School Library Journal</h3>
      <p>Adult/High School-Kaelin Ring (Ravenheart) is growing up
      in a society torn by hatred. The proud Rigante are subjugated
      by the equally proud Varlish, and neither group sees much of
      value in the other. A series of atrocities, graphically but
      not gratuitously described, sharpen Kaelin Ring's hatred. He
      kills two Varlish soldiers who are about to escape justice
      for raping a young Varlish woman who dared to associate with
      him. The scenario will be familiar enough to anyone who sees
      the news reports of ethnic strife around the globe. In
      Gemmell's hands, the tale evolves into something more
      complex, and members of each group slowly recognize the
      nobility present in members of the other, and come to terms
      with some of their own weaknesses. Kaelin's awkward
      relationship with a young woman he desires, Chara Jace, adds
      to the cauldron of emotions. Gemmell gives readers heroes
      with deep flaws and antagonists with surprising moments of
      virtue, as well as a few entertainingly black-hearted
      villains. The frequently bloody action is interspersed with
      epiphanies about the value of human life, and Kaelin's
      experiences are balanced with those of a Varlish boy, Gaise
      Macon, aka Stormrider. (A sequel to Ravenheart, Stormrider is
      due out in February, 2002.) This fast-moving book will appeal
      to fans of action and adventure. The book uses material from
      The Sword in the Storm and Midnight Falcon (both Ballantine,
      2001) for background, but since those books were set 800
      years earlier, this one doesn't seem at all like a
      sequel.</p>
