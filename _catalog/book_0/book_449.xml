      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        In his acclaimed Codex Alera novels, bestselling author
      Jim Butcher has created a fascinating world in which the
      powerful forces of nature take physical form. But even magic
      cannot sway the corruption that threatens to destroy the
      realm of Alera once and for all.

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Butcher deftly mixes military fantasy and political
      intrigue in the rollicking third Codex Alera book (after
      2005's
        <em>Academ's Fury</em>
        ). Gaius Sextus, the First Lord of
      Alera, plants his nephew Tavi in a new legion, where Tavi can
      gather information on the rebellious High Lord of Kalare.
      Tavi, now a full-fledged Cursor, or spy, infiltrates the
      legion under the assumed identity of an officer, a station
      the green young man has not yet actually achieved. Treachery
      from a supposed ally opens the legion to attack from its
      bestial enemies, the Canim, incapacitating the captain and
      catapulting Tavi to the rank of the legion's commanding
      officer. Cut off from contact with the First Lord and with
      few seasoned officers to guide him, he must lead the troops
      in a defense of the Imperium against a horde of frenzied
      Canim warriors set on annihilating the Aleri people. Readers
      will cheer Tavi every step of the way.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        The third Codex Alera volume opens with Gaius, first lord
      of Alera, recovered from the murderous attack in
        <em>Academ's Fury</em>
        (2005) and seeking two would-be first
      lords' destruction. Tavi, young protagonist of the preceding
      books, he sends off for legionary training. Kalare, one of
      Gaius' targets, then takes hostages, depriving Gaius of much
      support. Gaius' personal spy Amara is dispatched to effect a
      rescue, for which she needs the help of Lady Aquitaine, close
      kin to the other would-be and one who never balks at
      disposing of those in her way. Sequences of Tavi's basic
      training alternate with Amara's rescue mission, providing
      lots of action.
