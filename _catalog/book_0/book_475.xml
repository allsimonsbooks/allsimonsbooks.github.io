      Book 3 in the Troy series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Outside the golden city of Troy, Prince Hektor leads the
    Trojan cavalry in daring raids against the forces led by his
    young rival, the peerless warrior Achilles. Meanwhile, burning
    for vengeance after the brutal murder of his wife, Helikaon
    commands the Trojan fleet, sowing misery and death among the
    Mykene navy and supply ships. But even these mighty efforts are
    of scant avail against the hordes of battle-hardened Mykene
    infantry, the Myrmidon soldiers of Achilles, and the cunning
    strategies of Odysseus, compelled against his heart’s
    urgings to aid the cause of Agamemnon.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Now, before the gates of Troy, Hektor and Achilles will find
    themselves inexorably drawn into a battle of champions that
    will decide the fate of the innocents trapped within the city
    walls. There, as King Priam slips into madness,
    Andromache–wife of Hektor, lover of Helikaon, mother,
    warrior, and priestess–must navigate a maze of treachery
    and danger to save her children and her city from the massacre
    about to unfold.</p>

    <p xmlns="">
      In this last installment of David Gemmell's Trojan trilogy
    (following Troy: Shield of Thunder), Helen is a plain, mousy
    woman whose beauty is entirely of the inner sort, and Hektor is
    a cuckold left raising another man's son. Agamemnon is depicted
    as a rapacious predator seeking the riches of Troy to support
    the armies he needs to hold the territories he has conquered,
    and Priam a shadow of his former glory, brought low by an
    Alzheimer's-like disease. Strong characterizations and sturdy
    plotting evoke the horror of the conflict, and the story's
    mythic power. David Gemmell left the novel uncompleted upon his
    untimely death in 2006, but his wife, Stella, who did most of
    his research, has brought the books to a satisfactory
    conclusion.

    <p xmlns="">
      “If Hollywood wants to find a new book-based,
    war-filled fantasy franchise that repeats the success of
      <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>
      and
      <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>
      . . . it may want to look to
    Gemmell for inspiration.”—

    deception.”—
