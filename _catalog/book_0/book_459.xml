      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <h3 xmlns="">Amazon.com Review</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping
    under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an
    absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by
    wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and
    jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry,
    curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that
    you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to
    young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut
    novel,
      <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em>
      . In the nonmagic
    human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated
    like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him
    when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the
    world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor
    of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a
    lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined
    sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him
    that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt,
    uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid,
    wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We
    are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle
    Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME
    CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough,
    however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig...
    and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and
    suspenseful--begins.
      <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em>
      , first published
    in England as
      <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em>
      , continues to
    win major awards in England. So far it has won the National
    Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and
    is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the
    Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future
    classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for
      <em>--Karin Snelson</em>

    <h3 xmlns="">From Publishers Weekly</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      Readers are in for a delightful romp with this award-winning
    debut from a British author who dances in the footsteps of P.L.
    Travers and Roald Dahl. As the story opens, mysterious
    goings-on ruffle the self-satisfied suburban world of the
    Dursleys, culminating in a trio of strangers depositing the
    Dursleys' infant nephew Harry in a basket on their doorstep.
    After 11 years of disregard and neglect at the hands of his
    aunt, uncle and their swinish son Dudley, Harry suddenly
    receives a visit from a giant named Hagrid, who informs Harry
    that his mother and father were a witch and a wizard, and that
    he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
    himself. Most surprising of all, Harry is a legend in the witch
    world for having survived an attack by the evil sorcerer
    Voldemort, who killed his parents and left Harry with a
    lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. And so the fun begins,
    with Harry going off to boarding school like a typical English
    kid?only his supplies include a message-carrying owl and a
    magic wand. There is enchantment, suspense and danger galore
    (as well as enough creepy creatures to satisfy the most
    bogeymen-loving readers, and even a magical game of soccerlike
    Quidditch to entertain sports fans) as Harry and his friends
    Ron and Hermione plumb the secrets of the forbidden third floor
    at Hogwarts to battle evil and unravel the mystery behind
    Harry's scar. Rowling leaves the door wide open for a sequel;
    bedazzled readers will surely clamor for one. Ages 8-12.
