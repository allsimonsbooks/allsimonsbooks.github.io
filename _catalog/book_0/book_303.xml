      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      From
      <i>Snuff</i>
      : 'Vimes' prompt arrival got a nod of approval from
    Sybil, who gingerly handed him a new book to read to Young Sam.
    Vimes looked at the cover. The title was
      <i>The World of Poo</i>
      . When his wife was out of eyeshot he
    carefully leafed through it. Well, okay, you had to accept that
    the world had moved on and these days fairy stories were
    probably not going to be about twinkly little things with
    wings. As he turned page after page, it dawned on him that
    whoever had written this book, they certainly knew what would
    make kids like Young Sam laugh until they were nearly sick. The
    bit about sailing down the river almost made
      <i>him</i>
      smile. But interspersed with the scatology was
    actually quite interesting stuff about septic tanks and
    dunnakin divers and gongfermors and how dog muck helped make
    the very best leather, and other things that you never thought
    you would need to know, but once heard somehow lodged in your
    mind.'
