      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        In his acclaimed Codex Alera novels, bestselling author
      Jim Butcher has created a fascinating world in which the
      elemental forces of nature take physical form and are used
      for protection. Now, as enemies become allies and friends
      become bitter foes, a danger beyond reckoning looms for all.

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Sharp tactical plotting, hazardous cross-country travel
      and a dash of sardonic humor mark Butcher's fourth Codex
      Alera novel (after 2006's
        <em>Cursor's Fury</em>
        ). Two years into a difficult campaign
      against the wolflike Canim invaders, Calderon legion captain
      Tavi is saddled with an unqualified but politically powerful
      superior whose plans threaten disaster and force Tavi into
      potential treason. Meanwhile, aging ruler Gaius Sextus plans
      a final strike against the rebellious lord of Kalare, but to
      get close enough to act, he must set aside his power to
      control the elements and make a painful overland slog that
      neatly challenges genre conventions. Butcher deftly deploys
      intrigue, conflicted loyalties and hairbreadth action to
      excellent effect. Few writers balance military realism and
      cinematic swashbuckling with so much skill or wit. Series
      fans will welcome the revelation of Tavi's long-secret
      heritage and the strong climaxes resolving most of the
      immediate conflicts, while newcomers will have no trouble
      navigating the well-developed landscape.
