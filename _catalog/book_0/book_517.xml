      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">THE DRIVE OF PROPHECY</p>
    <p xmlns="">The quest was over. The Orb of Aldur was restored. And once
    again, with the crowning of Garion, there was a descendant of
    Riva Iron-grip to rule as Overlord of the West.</p>
    <p xmlns="">But the Prophecy was unfulfilled. In the east, the evil God
    Torak was about to awaken and seek dominion. Somehow, Garion
    had to face the God, to kill or be killed. On the outcome of
    that dread duel rested the destiny of the world. Now,
    accompanied by his grandfather, the ancient sorcerer Belgarath,
    Garion headed toward the City of Endless Night, where Torak
    awaited him.</p>
    <p xmlns="">To the south, his fianc√©e, the princess Ce'Nedra, led
    the armies of the West in a desperate effort to divert the
    forces of Torak's followers from the man she loved.</p>
    <p xmlns="">The Prophecy drove Garion on. But it gave no answer to the
    question that haunted him: How does a man kill an immortal
    God?</p>
    <p xmlns="">Here is the brilliant conclusion to the epic of The
    Belgariad, which began in Pawn of Prophecy--a novel of fate,
    strange lands, and a Prophecy that must be fulfilled--the
    resolution of the war of men, Kings, and Gods that had spanned
    seven thousand years!</p>
