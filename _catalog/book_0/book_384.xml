      Book 5 in the Heroes of Olympus series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p style="font-family: 'MS Shell Dlg 2';">
        Though the Greek
      and Roman crewmembers of the
        <em>Argo II</em>
        have made progress in their many quests,
      they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother,
      Gaea. Her giants have risen-all of them-and they're stronger
      than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes,
      when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens.
      She needs their blood-the blood of Olympus-in order to
      wake.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS Shell Dlg 2';">
        The demigods are
      having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp
      Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by
      Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is
      tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a
      secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs
      back on Long Island, where it
        <em>might</em>
        be able to stop a war between the two
      camps.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'MS Shell Dlg 2';">
        The Athena
      Parthenos will go west; the
        <em>Argo II</em>
        will go east. The gods, still suffering from
      multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful
      of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of
      powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens,
      they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much
      already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.
