      <strong>Summary</strong>

    <h3 xmlns="">
      <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px;">Hunted now by
      the fearsome warlock wardens who rule the world, Inos is
      convinced that Rap is dead. But Rap is not, and the tide may
      be about to turn... She thought he was dead. Queen Inos feels
      Rap's presence as if he has risen from the grave to be beside
      her, but she knows all that is left of him is his voice,
      which echoed in her mind--well, so she thinks. Her duty is to
      serve her people, and Queen Inos doesn't know her galley
      slave, Rap, is alive and, with his magic wand, trying to
      bring happiness to his beloved Queen. But when the evil
      Nordland raider, Kalkor, arrives in port, Rap's plans begin
      to fall apart.</span>
