<strong>Series: </strong>Book 1 in the Stormlight Archive series</p>
<p>
<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
      
<p>Brandon Sanderson, widely acclaimed for his work
      completing Robert Jordan&rsquo;s Wheel of Time saga,&nbsp;
      begins a grand cycle of his own, with The Way of Kings, Book
      One of the Stormlight Archive.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of
      incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently
      that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals
      hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts
      into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the
      topography offers shelter.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten
      consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their
      Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits
      of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible
      warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were
      fought for them, and won by them.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the
      Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical
      apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has
      been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where
      ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he
      struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who
      consider them expendable.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other
      armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by
      an ancient text called 
      <em>The Way of Kings</em>. Troubled by over-powering visions
      of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to
      doubt his own sanity.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan
      seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious
      heretic, Dalinar&rsquo;s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely
      loves learning, Shallan&rsquo;s motives are less than pure.
      As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at
      secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and
      world-building, 
      <em>The Way of Kings</em> is but the opening movement of the
      Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.

          <em>This massive tome is the first of a 10-part epic
          fantasy series from relative newcomer Sanderson
          (Mistborn), best known for his efforts to complete the
          late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. In a
          storm-swept world where history has dwindled into myth,
          self-serving aristocrats squabble over mystical weapons
          that render their bearers immune to mundane attacks. The
          ambitious scholar Shallan learns unexpected truths about
          the present, the virtuous aristocrat Dalinar reclaims the
          lost past, and the bitter and broken slave Kaladin gains
          unwanted power. Race-related plot themes may raise some
          eyebrows, and there's no hope for anything resembling a
          conclusion in this introductory volume, but Sanderson's
          fondness for misleading the reader and his talent for
          feeding out revelations and action scenes at just the
          right pace will keep epic fantasy fans intrigued and
          hoping for redemptive future installments.

<em>
          <em>This colossal volume opens a fantasy saga clearly
          influenced by the Wheel of Time, which the author is in
          fact finishing. It&rsquo;s a classic story of intrigue,
          magic, and war, with a large cast of characters and
          multiple settings lovingly detailed in a way only
          possible in volumes of this size. Two characters stand
          out. One is Shallin, a young woman seeking to enter the
          household of a royal princess so that she can steal a
          magical talisman and restore the tattered fortunes of her
          family. The other is Kaladin, a gifted young soldier
          enslaved for desertion, who fights his way back to
          freedom in battles on the Shattered Plain. There&rsquo;s
          wit (Shallin&rsquo;s amiably unscrupulous sailor protect
          Yod is a gem), magic (the weather is almost a character
          in its own right), and erudition (if the fighting on the
          Shattered Plain doesn&rsquo;t owe something to WWI, this
          reviewer would be surprised). Readers will plunge into
          it, even as they send up cries for a glossary and cast of
          characters. --Roland Green</em>
