    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Fierce and proud, the Rigante dwell deep in the green
      mountain lands, worshiping the gods of air and water, and the
      spirits of the earth.  Among them lives a warrior
      who bears the mark of fate. Born of the storm that slew his
      father, he is Connavar, and tales of his courage spread like
      wildfire.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The Seidh--a magical race as old as time--take note of the
      young warrior and cast a malignant shadow across his life.
      For soon a merciless army will cross the water, destroying
      forever the timeless rhythms of life among the Rigante.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Swearing to protect his people, Connavar embarks on a
      quest that will take him into the heart of the enemy. Along
      the way, he receives a gift: a sword as powerful and deadly
      as the Seidh who forged it. Thus he receives a name that will
      strike fear into the hearts of friend and foe alike--a name
      proclaiming a glorious and bitter destiny . . .

      <h3>About the Author</h3>
      <p>David Gemmell was born in London, England, in the summer
      of 1948. Expelled from school at sixteen, he became a
      bouncer, working at nightclubs in Soho. Born with a silver
      tongue, Gemmell rarely needed to bounce customers, relying on
      his gift of gab to talk his way out of trouble. This talent
      eventually led to a job as freelancer for the London Daily
      Mail, Daily Mirror, and Daily Express. His first novel,
      Legend, was published in 1984 and has remained in print ever
      since. He became a full-time writer in 1986.</p>
