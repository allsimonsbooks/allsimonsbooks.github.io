      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">

        <strong>
          The next book in the thrilling
          <em>New York Times</em>
          bestselling series.

        For years he has endured the endless trials and triumphs
      of a man whose skill and power could not be restrained.
      Battling ancient enemies, forging new alliances, and
      confronting the corruption within his own land, Gaius
      Octavian became a legendary man of war-and the rightful First
      Lord of Alera.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, the savage Vord are on the march, and Gaius must
      lead his legions to the Calderon Valley to stand against
      them-using all of his intelligence, ingenuity, and furycraft
      to save their world from eternal darkness.

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        The creativity Butcher displays in his Dresden Files
      series is less apparent in the derivative sixth fantasy yarn
      set in quasi-Roman Alera (after 2008's
        <em>Princeps' Fury</em>
        ). New readers are tossed into a
      complex plot without any explanation of the considerable
      backstory, making it hard to connect with the characters or
      action. The book centers around yet another world-shaking
      battle between good, represented by Alera, and evil,
      represented by the vord queen and her legions of scorpionlike
      followers. A major character is falsely believed dead;
      there's a traitor in the ranks of the good guys; there's also
      heroic sacrifice, combat against overwhelming odds, etc.
      Banter in moments of extreme crisis is absurdly common but
      never convincing, and neither characters nor story develop
      anything resembling depth.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>The fitting conclusion to the Codex Alera ties up a lot of
      loose ends. Tavi, first lord of Alera since his
      grandfather’s death, struggles to hold together a realm
      about to shatter. The insectile Vord hold far too much of the
      land, including areas that surrendered willingly.
      Alera’s old enemies, the Canim, are now allies, which
      makes both reluctant partners tense. Certain Alerans of rank
      persist in nattering over whether Tavi is the rightful ruler.
      And Tavi’s lover, Kitai, insists on being properly
      courted to maintain respectability in Aleran eyes. With Tavi
      trying to keep ahead of one quandary after another and find a
      way to defeat the Vord, and with various intriguers met in
      the previous five volumes trying to salvage their schemes,
      the pace here is much faster than in the immediately
      preceding Cursor’s Fury (2006), Captain’s Fury
      (2007), and Princeps’ Fury (2008). --Frieda Murray</p>
