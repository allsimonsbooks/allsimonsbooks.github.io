      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">This 4,000 copy Limited Artist Edition is numbered and is
    signed by Michael Whelan. It is issued in a foil stamped
    slipcase. Published in a larger format than the Dark Tower
    series which enhances Michael Whelan's thirteen full color
    plates and overtwenty three black &amp; white designs."The Man
    in Black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed."
    This is our introduction to Roland Deschain, the last
    Gunslinger, published by Donald M. Grant in THE DARK TOWER: THE
    GUNSLINGER in 1982. Twenty years later Stephen King revised and
    expanded this volume. In his own words: "What I did want to do
    was to give newcomers to the tale of the Tower (and old readers
    who want to refresh their memories) a clearer start and a
    slightly easier entry into Roland's world. I also wanted them
    to have a volume that more effectively foreshadowed coming
    events.This volume contains that expanded version as well as
    the novella THE LITTLE SISTERS OF ELURIA which chronicles an
    earlier adventure of Roland's as he persued the Man in
    Black.</p>
