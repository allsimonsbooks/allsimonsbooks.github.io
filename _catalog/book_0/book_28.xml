        The adventure began
      in a fading town. Far from anyone he knew or trusted, a young
      Lemony Snicket started an apprenticeship for a secret
      organization shrouded in mystery and secrecy. He asked
      questions that shouldn't have been on his mind. Now he has
      written an account that should not be published that
      shouldn't be read. Not even by you. Seriously, we recommend
      that you do NOT ask your parents for this, the first book in
      his new ALL THE WRONG QUESTIONS series.
        <br />
        Lemony Snicket, in case you don't already know, grew up
      to be the author of A Series of Unfortunate Events
      series.
