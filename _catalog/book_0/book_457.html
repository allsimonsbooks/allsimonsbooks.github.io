<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<h3 xmlns="">Amazon.com Review</h3>
<p>It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young
    hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps
    into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's 
    <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em>, the much
    anticipated sequel to the award-winning __, he is in terrible
    danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long
    summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts
    to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
    Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only
    transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his
    luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping
    Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared
    to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of
    Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to
    Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is
    out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about
    survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The
    mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim,
    "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir,
    Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and
    Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking
    their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly
    mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as
    gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar
    student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes,
    pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre,
    horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling
    writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the
    macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the
    next installment. (Ages 9 and older)

<h3>From School Library Journal</h3>
<p>Grade 3-8-Fans of the phenomenally popular Harry Potter and
    the Sorcerer's Stone (Scholastic, 1998) won't be disappointed
    when they rejoin Harry, now on break after finishing his first
    year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Reluctantly
    spending the summer with the Dursleys, his mean relatives who
    fear and detest magic, Harry is soon whisked away by his
    friends Ron, Fred, and George Weasley, who appear at his window
    in a flying Ford Anglia to take him away to enjoy the rest of
    the holidays with their very wizardly family. Things don't go
    as well, though, when the school term begins. Someone, or
    something, is (literally) petrifying Hogwarts' residents one by
    one and leaving threatening messages referring to a Chamber of
    Secrets and an heir of Slytherin. Somehow, Harry is often
    around when the attacks happen and he is soon suspected of
    being the perpetrator. The climax has Harry looking very much
    like Indiana Jones, battling a giant serpent in the depths of
    the awesome and terrible Chamber of Secrets. Along with most of
    the teachers and students introduced in the previous book,
    Draco Malfoy has returned for his second year and is more
    despicable than ever. The novel is marked throughout by the
    same sly and sophisticated humor found in the first book, along
    with inventive, new, matter-of-fact uses of magic that will
    once again have readers longing to emulate Harry and his wizard
    friends.
