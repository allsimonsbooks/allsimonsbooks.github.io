      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">Lemony Snicket lovers, it's unfortunate,
    but it's true: Book the Tenth is here, and it's as chillingly
    cheerless as ever! Picking up where Book the Ninth left off,
    Violet and Klaus are stuck in the rolling caravan and are
    desperate to rescue their sister, Sunny. Thankfully, they roll
    to safety by the skin of their sad teeth, but little do they
    realize that their trek into the Mortmain Mountains will bring
    them face to face with a horde of stinging snow gnats, a group
    of bizarre snow scouts, and eventually Count Olaf himself. But
    Snicket's installment isn't as hopeless as it may sound --
    there are many juicy hints inside as to the mystery of V.F.D.,
    the fate of the Baudelaire parents, and even how Snicket
    himself fits into the whole series. The slippery author's tenth
    entry includes surprises at every turn -- particularly when a
    long-forgotten character turns up -- and fans will be aching to
    find out what happens next in this alpine-themed cliff-hanger
    that's an important piece of Snicket's puzzle.</p>
