      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 1 in the Legion series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Brandon Sanderson is one of the most significant
      fantasists to enter the field in a good many years. His
      ambitious, multi-volume epics (
        <em>Mistborn</em>
        ,
        <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>
        ) and his stellar continuation
      of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series have earned
      both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In
        <em>Legion</em>
        , a distinctly contemporary novella filled
      with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention,
      Sanderson reveals a startling new facet of his singular
      narrative talent.

        Stephen Leeds, AKA “Legion,” is a man whose
      unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of
      personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of
      personal characteristics and a vast array of highly
      specialized skills. As the story begins, Leeds and his
      “aspects” are drawn into the search for the
      missing Balubal Razon, inventor of a camera whose astonishing
      properties could alter our understanding of human history and
      change the very structure of society. The action ranges from
      the familiar environs of America to the ancient, divided city
      of Jerusalem. Along the way, Sanderson touches on a
      formidable assortment of complex questions: the nature of
      time, the mysteries of the human mind, the potential uses of
      technology, and the volatile connection between politics and
      faith.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Resonant, intelligent, and thoroughly absorbing,
        <em>Legion</em>
        is a provocative entertainment from a writer
      of great originality and seemingly limitless gifts.
