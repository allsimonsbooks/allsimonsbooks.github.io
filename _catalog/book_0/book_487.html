<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
      
<p>Once the legendary knights of the Gabala defended the nine
      duchies. Their hearts were beautiful; their armor was beyond
      compare. They were greater than princes, more than men.
      <br>But they were gone, disappeared through a demon-haunted
      gateway between worlds. Only one held back -- Manannan, whose
      every instinct told him to stay. Now he was the coward
      knight, and in torment.
      <br>Murder and black magic beset the land. Rumors
      circulated that the king was enchanted, changed, that his
      soul was dead . . . and that a reign of terror was about to
      begin.
      <br>Now Manannan realized he would have to face his darkest
      fears: he had no choice but to ride through that dreaded gate
      and seek out his vanished companions.
      <br>And the secret he would learn there would tear his soul
      apart . . . .
      <br>"A sharp, distinctive medieval fantasy. Dramatic,
      colorful, taut." -- Locus</p>
