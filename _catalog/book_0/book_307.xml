          According to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of
        Agnes Nutter -the world's only "totally reliable" guide to
        the future - the world will end on a Saturday.
          <br />
          <br />
          Next Saturday, in fact.
          <br />
          Just after tea.
          <br />
          Which means that Armageddon will happen on a Saturday
        night.
          <br />
          There will be seas of fire, rains of fish, the moon
        turning to blood and the massed armies of Heaven and Hell
        will sort it outonce and for all.
          <br />
          <br />
          Which is a major problem for Crowley, Hell's most
        approachable demon and former serpent, and his opposite
        number and old friend Aziraphale, genuine angel and Soho
        bookshop owner. They like it down here (or, in Crowley's
        case, up here).
          <br />
          <br />
          So they've got no alternative but to stop the Four
        Motorcyclists of the Apocalypse, defeat the marching ranks
        of the Witchfinder's army* and - somehow - stop it all
        happening.
          <br />
          <br />
          Above all (or, in Aziraphale's case, below all) they
        need to find and kill the Antichrist, currently the most
        powerful creature on Earth.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is a shame.
          <br />
          Because he's eleven years old, loves his dog even
        though it's really a Satanic hellhound under all that hair,
        really cares about the environment and is the sort of boy
        anyone would be proud to have as a son. He's also totally
        invulnerable, and a nice kid.
          <br />
          <br />
          And if that isn't enough, they've still got Sunday to
        deal with. . .
          <br />
          <br />
          * All two of them.
