      Book 3 in the Long Price Quartet series

      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Daniel Abraham delighted fantasy readers with his
      brilliantly original and engaging first novel, and in his
      second penned a tragedy as darkly personal and violent as
      Shakespeare’s
        <em>King Lear</em>
        . Now he has written an epic fantasy of
      much wider scope and appeal that will thrill his fans and
      enthrall legions of new readers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otah Machi, ruler of the city of Machi, has tried for
      years to prepare his people for a future in which the magical
        <em>andat</em>
        , entities that support their commerce and
      intimidate all foes, can no longer be safely harnessed. But
      his efforts are too little, too late. The Galts, an
      expansionist empire from across the sea, have tired of games
      of political espionage and low-stakes sabotage. Their
      general, a ruthless veteran, has found a way to do what was
      thought impossible: neutralize the andat.
      </p>
      <p>As the Galtic army advances, the Poets who control the
      andat wage their own battle to save their loved-ones and
      their nation. Failure seems inevitable, but success would end
      the Galtic threat.</p>
      <p>With wonderful storytelling skill, Abraham has wedded the
      unique magic, high-stakes betrayal and political intrigue of
      his previous works with a broad tapestry of action in a
      spectacular fantasy epic.</p>
      <h3>From Bookmarks Magazine</h3>
      <p>
        Much of the praise that SF critics offer for
        <em>An Autumn War</em>
        sounds like a review of a
      more-mainstream literary novel, with observations on
      Abrahamâ€™s complex and engaging characters,
      the multiple layers of power throughout his plot, and the
      excellent writing. â€œRarely does the
      penultimate volume in a series carry such a charge of its
      own,â€ notes
        <em>Locus</em>
        . But the reviewers return to full geek mode to
      gawk over the game-changing plot twist and ensuing
      cliff-hanger. Subtle plot development and engaging characters
      are great, they seem to sayâ€"but, just to show
      how compelling this series really is, what they really want
      is the next (and last) book,
        <em>The Price of Spring</em>
        (2009).

      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>
        "
        <em>A Betrayal in Winter</em>
        is exactly the kind of book I
      love: dynamic characters, sharp plotting, and an original,
      thoughtful take on magic." —Brandon Sanderson, author
      of
        <em>Mistborn</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Compellingly plotted and elegantly written,
        <em>A Betrayal in Winter</em>
        is a very successful
      continuation of what promises to be a significant and
      original contribution to fantasy literature.”
