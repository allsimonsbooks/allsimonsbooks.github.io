      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Gesture and posture convey as much information as spoken
      words in Abraham's impressive first novel, a fantasy set in a
      world where poets create and bind powerful shape-shifting
      creatures called "andat." The Empire hangs on, literally, by
      a thread; the cloth industry depends on the ability of andat
      Seedless to magically remove seeds from cotton plants to keep
      commerce flowing and the barbarians in check. Seedless, who
      can also remove unborn children from their mother's womb,
      aims to drive his poet-creator, Heshai-kvo, mad with grief. A
      love triangle develops among a threesome—Heshai's
      apprentice, Maati; Itani, a laborer with a past; and the
      beautiful scribe Liat—as they unknowingly assist the
      andat in his plot to abort a wanted child. When Liat's
      master, Amat Kyaan, uncovers the plan, Amat must flee and
      live as a bookkeeper in a brothel. The complex characters all
      struggle to navigate a path between their duty to their
      Empire and to themselves. A blurb from George R.R. Martin
      will help alert his fans to this promising newcomer.

      <h3>From Bookmarks Magazine</h3>
      <p>
        Debut novelist Daniel Abraham bolts out of the gate with
      an enthusiastic recommendation from SF guru George R. R.
      Martin. The critics agree with Martin's appraisal, and
      reviewers welcome Abraham's rich characterization, deft
      plotting, and the particularly ambitious central conceit that
      ideas can be made flesh—and controlled by poets, no
      less. Critics nitpick here and there (a communication method
      that involves posing rather than speaking furrows some
      eyebrows), but nothing dissuades reviewers from eagerly
      awaiting the Fall, Winter, and Spring installments. (
        <em>Winter Cities</em>
        will be published in 2007.)
