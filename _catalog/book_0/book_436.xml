        The Warden Morgan has been accused of treason against the
      Wizards of the White Council—and there’s only
      one, final punishment for that crime. He’s on the run,
      wants his name cleared, and needs someone with a knack for
      backing the underdog. Someone like Harry Dresden...
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Now, Harry must uncover a traitor within the Council, keep
      a less-than-agreeable Morgan under wraps, and avoid coming
      under scrutiny himself. And a single mistake may cost someone
      his head—someone like Harry</p>
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        The search for a traitor in the highest circles of power
      forms the main plot thread of Butcher's 11th hard-boiled
      fantasy novel featuring Chicago's wizard detective Harry
      Dresden (last seen in 2008's
        <em>Small Favor</em>
        ). Harry, a warden of the magic-governing
      White Council, finds himself in an unusual position when
      Morgan, his fellow warden and frequent antagonist, asks for
      his help. One of the White Council's leaders has been
      murdered, and Morgan was found at the scene of the crime
      holding the murder weapon. If he has been framed, then
      another senior wizard is behind the killing and may be trying
      to destroy the council entirely. Aided by werewolf and
      vampire allies, Dresden investigates with his trademark
      sardonic noir flair. Despite the sprawling plot, both fans
      and newcomers will get into the fast-paced action.

      <h3>From School Library Journal</h3>
      <p>
        When fans of the immensely popular
        <em>Dresden Files</em>
        series last left the urban wizard in
        <em>Small Favor</em>
        , he was dealing with the aftermath of an
      adventure that might have left his best friend's life and
      family in danger. But Harry is back in fine form in his 11th
      outing, which begins with another, extremely unexpected White
      Council Warden begging for sanctuary at Harry's place and
      ends with several frightening revelations. Once again,
      Butcher's urban fantasy features excellent, irreverent humor,
      the return of favorite characters, and new challenges from
      unexpected foes. Harry's cop friend, the tiny but fierce
      Murphy, sticks by his side here, as do the werewolves Harry
      befriended in 2001's
        <em>Fool Moon</em>
        . Longtime readers will not be
      disappointed. Recommended for public libraries collecting the
      series; this is also a great book to plunge newbies into the
      dark, magical side of Chicago.—Stacey Rottiers, Warren
