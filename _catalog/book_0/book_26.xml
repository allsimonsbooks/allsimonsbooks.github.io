      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      Dear Reader,
      <br />
      <br />
      You are presumably looking at the back of this book, or
    the end of the end. The end of the end is the best place to
    begin the end, because if you read the end from the beginning
    of the beginning of the end to the end of the end of the end,
    you will arrive at the end of the end of your rope.
      <br />
      <br />
      This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events,
    and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you
    probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a
    suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird
    cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents.
      <br />
      <br />
      It has been my solemn occupation to complete the history
    of the Baudelaire orphans, and at last I am finished. You
    likely have some other occupation, so if I were you I would
    drop this book at once, so the end does not finish you.
      <br />
      <br />
      With all due respect,
      <br />
      <br />
      Lemony SnicketÂ
