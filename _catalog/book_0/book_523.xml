      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">She soars above a world of warriors, kings, and priests. The
    daughter of Belgarath and the shape-shifter Poledra, she has
    fought wars, plotted palace coups, and worked her powerful
    magic for three thousand years. Now, Polgara looks back at her
    magnificent life, in this fitting crown jewel to the saga that
    is the Eddings' Belgariad and Mallorean cycles.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Her hair streaked white by her father's first touch, her
    mind guided by a mother she will not see again for centuries,
    Polgara begins life in her Uncle Beldin's tower, and in the
    prehistorical, magical Tree that stands in the middle of the
    Vale. There, she first learns the reaches of her powers. There
    she assumes the bird shapes that will serve her on her
    adventures. And there she starts on the path toward her destiny
    as Duchess of Erat, shepherdess of the cause of good, adversary
    of Torak the One-Eyed Dragon God, and guardian of the world's
    last, best hope: the heir to the Rivan throne.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Here is the legendary life story of a woman of wit, passion,
    and complex emotions, a woman born of two majestic parents who
    could not have been more unlike one another. Ordained to make
    peace and make war, to gain love and lose love, Polgara lives
    out her family's rich prophecy in the ceaseless struggle
    between the Light and the Dark.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Polgara is the epic culmination of a magnificent saga, and a
    fitting farewell to a world which, once experienced, will never
    be forgotten.</p>
