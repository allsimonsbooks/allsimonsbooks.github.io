      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 1 in the Dresden Files series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>For Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard,
      business, to put it mildly, stinks. So when the police bring
      him in to consult on a grisly double murder committed with
      black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs. But where there's
      black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that
      mage knows Harry's name.</p>
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        As in the audio adaptation of Butcher's first Dresden
      Files novel, Storm Front, Marsters (who played Spike on Buffy
      the Vampire Slayer) slips easily into the role of
      down-on-his-luck wizard Harry Dresden. Marsters's
      self-deprecating tone fits the character perfectly; he reads
      with a dry, ironic humor that doesn't mask Harry's genuine
      concern for the lives of innocents. Marsters also displays a
      remarkable skill for lending even the strangest characters
      and creatures voices-including gentleman gangster Johnny
      Marconi, his henchmen, a sexy female werewolf and Bob, the
      British-accented talking skull. In this outing, Harry is
      again out of cash, and police detective Karrin Murphy, who's
      still angry at him over the events of the first book, isn't
      inclined to throw work his way. But soon a series of
      mysterious, violent murders sends her to Harry for help. Are
      the killings the work of a local motorcycle gang? Or a
      werewolf-and if so, which werewolf? Mac Finn, the werewolf
      environmentalist? The group of idealistic college kids who
      voluntarily become werewolves by night? Or the trigger-happy
      group of FBI agents turned werewolf vigilantes? Though the
      price of this audio package may put off some listeners,
      Marsters's lively telling makes it worth every penny.
