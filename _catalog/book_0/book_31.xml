      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        <em>I should have asked the question "How could someone who
        was missing be in two places at once?" Instead, I asked the
        wrong question -- four wrong questions, more or less. This
        is the account of the second.</em>
      </p>
      <p>In the fading town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, young apprentice
      Lemony Snicket has a new case to solve when he and his
      chaperone are hired to find a missing girl. Is the girl a
      runaway? Or was she kidnapped? Was she seen last at the
      grocery store? Or could she have stopped at the diner? Is it
      really any of your business? These are All The Wrong
      Questions.</p>
      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>In book two of the All the Wrong Questions series, we find
      young Lemony still in Stain’d-by-the-Sea, still in the
      company of mentor S. Theodora Markson, but with a new mystery
      to solve: Where is Miss Cleo Knight? And what is the secret
      project on which she has been working? But as Snicket’s
      pal, reporter Moxie Mallahan, knows, those aren’t the
      right questions, at least as far as the big picture is
      concerned. These are: What is this job exactly? Where did you
      come from? How long will you stay? When will you leave? Why
      are you investigating things in this town? Though the Cleo
      case gets closed, the larger issues remain, becoming
      curiouser and curiouser. While we wait for answers, Snicket
      introduces a sometimes charming, more often alarming cast of
      characters: the bickering husband-and-wife police force (and
      their smirking son, Stew); Pip and Squeak, the taxi-driving
      Bellerophon brothers; the mysterious (and cute) Ellington
      Feint; and the mysterious (and sinister) Hangfire—all
      of whom keep the pages turning. The droll young Snicket makes
      a perfect presenter as he careens from difficulty to
      difficulty, yet always with his eye on the ball. Or is it?
      HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: The major marketing campaign
      continues, including a national author tour. There’s no
      stopping Snicket! Grades 4-7. --Ilene Cooper</p>
