      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>In Furies of Calderon, bestselling author Jim Butcher
      introduced readers to a world where the forces of nature take
      physical form. But now, it's human nature that threatens to
      throw the realm into chaos.</p>
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Best known for his Harry Dresden fantasy noir novels (
        <em>Dead Beat</em>
        , etc.), bestseller Butcher shows he's
      equally adept at epic fantasy in the second Codex Alera book.
      Two years after the events of
        <em>Furies of Calderon</em>
        (2004), the First Lord of Alera,
      Gaius Sextus, struggles to control a realm facing growing
      border troubles and civil strife as High Lords scheme to
      advance their own causes. Fortunately, Gaius has loyal
      supporters such as his nephew Tavi, now a 17-year-old Academ,
      a student of Alera Imperial's great Academy, who also serves
      as Gaius's page and is secretly training to become a Cursor,
      one of the First Lord's elite spies. Then Gaius falls ill,
      leaving those closest to him, including Tavi, desperate to
      keep his weakness secret. With Cursors being murdered, an
      ancient menace known as the "vord" heading for the capital
      and civil war on the horizon, Tavi has his work cut out for
      him. Butcher skillfully weaves in the necessary back story
      without slowing the pace. Solid world-building, intriguing
      characters and vivid action make this a solid addition to a
      marvelously entertaining series.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        Tavi, the young hero of
        <em>Furies of Calderon</em>
        (2004), is now in the capital,
      ostensibly serving as a page but secretly training to become
      a spy. When the first lord falls to a sorcerous attack, Tavi
      and his closest friends and teachers must conceal the lord's
      condition lest the realm fall into civil war. In the Calderon
      Valley, a long--forgotten horror awakens and heads for the
      heart of Alera, while Tavi's closest relative, the newly
      appointed Steadholder Isana, faces at least two sets of
      assassins. This is a fine coming-of-age, fantasy-action
      novel. The characterizations are excellent, and the plotting
      is very well developed. The second book of the Codex Alera,
      though not as exciting as
        <em>Furies,</em>
        includes plenty of action, and Butcher
      provides enough background so that it can be enjoyed without
      having read its predecessor.
