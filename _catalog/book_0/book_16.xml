      Book 3 in the Series of Unfortunate Events series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      In
      <i>The Bad Beginning</i>
      , things, well, begin badly for the
    three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in
      <i>The Reptile Room</i>
      . In the third in Lemony Snicket's
    Series of Unfortunate Events, there is still no hope on the
    horizon for these poor children. Their adventures are exciting
    and memorable, but, as the author points out, "exciting and
    memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of
    thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you."
      <p>This story begins when the orphans are being escorted by the
    well-meaning Mr. Poe to yet another distant relative who has
    agreed to take them in since their parents were killed in a
    horrible fire. Aunt Josephine, their new guardian, is their
    second cousin's sister-in-law, and she is afraid of everything.
    Her house (perched precariously on a cliff above Lake
    Lachrymose) is freezing because she is afraid of the radiator
    exploding, she eats cold cucumber soup because she's afraid of
    the stove, and she doesn't answer the telephone due to
    potential electrocution dangers. Her greatest joy in life is
    grammar, however, and when it comes to the proper use of the
    English language, she is fearless.</p>
      <p>
        But just when she should be the most fearful--when Count
    Olaf creeps his way back to find the Baudelaire orphans and
    steal their fortune--she somehow lets her guard down. Once
    again, it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to get themselves
    out of danger. Will they succeed? We haven't the stomach to
    tell you. (Ages 9 to 12)
