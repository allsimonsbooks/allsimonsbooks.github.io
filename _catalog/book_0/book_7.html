<strong>Series: </strong>Book 6 in the Mistborn series</p>
<p>
<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
      
<p>
      
<strong>The #1 
      <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author returns to the
      world of 
      <em>Mistborn</em> with the follow-up to</strong> 
      <em>*</em>Shadows of Self*
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>With 
      <em>The Alloy of Law</em> and 
      <em>Shadows of Self</em>, Brandon Sanderson surprised readers
      with a 
      <em>New York Times</em> bestselling spinoff of his Mistborn
      books, set after the action of the trilogy, in a period
      corresponding to late 19th-century America.</p>
      
<p>Now, with 
      <em>The Bands of Mourning</em>, Sanderson continues the
      story. The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metalminds
      owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them
      the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly
      anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has
      returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the
      Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can
      read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the
      city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers
      hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and
      the shadowy organization known as The Set.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
      
<p>&ldquo;Sanderson is an evil genius. There is simply no
      other way to describe what he's managed to pull off in this
      transcendent final volume of his Mistborn trilogy.&rdquo;
      ―
      <em>RT Book Reviews (Gold Medal, Top Pick!) on The Hero of
      Ages</em>
</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;It's rare for a fiction writer to have much
      understanding of how leadership works and how love really
      takes root in the human heart. Sanderson is astonishingly
      wise.&rdquo; ―
      <em>Orson Scott Card</em>
</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Sanderson is crafting an extremely well-thought out
      saga with Mistborn, one that looks to stand above the pack of
      his literary peers. The magic system is perfectly detailed,
      the world, though not completely revealed, has a great sense
      of natural logic to it, and the characters are a reflection
      of both.&rdquo; ―
      <em>SFFWorld</em>
</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Intrigue, politics, and conspiracies mesh complexly
      in a world Sanderson realizes in satisfying depth and peoples
      with impressive characters.&rdquo; ―
      <em>Booklist on Mistborn</em>
</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Highly recommended to anyone hungry for a good
      read.&rdquo; ―
      <em>Robin Hobb on Mistborn</em>
</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;Enjoyable, adventurous read.&rdquo; ―
      <em>Locus on Mistborn</em>
</p>
