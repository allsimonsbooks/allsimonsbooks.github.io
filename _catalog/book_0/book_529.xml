      <strong>Summary</strong>

    <div xmlns="">
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Starred Review. Nothing ever goes the way I plan,
      laments Otah, long-suffering emperor of the Khaiem, concisely
      summarizing Abraham's melancholy and near-perfect conclusion
      to the Long Price Quartet. Fifteen years after the disaster
      that led to the sterilization of all Khaiem women and Galtish
      men in 2008's
        <em>An Autumn War</em>
        , Otah seeks an alliance between the
      two long-warring nations in hopes of there being a next
      generation, while former poet Maati tries to teach young
      women to summon andat, beings that embody and control
      concepts. Maati's student Vanjit harnesses the andat
      Clarity-of-Sight, but war trauma transforms her from possible
      savior into deranged dictator. Abraham shies away from the
      blood and swashbuckling of the previous novels, instead
      telling a tale of forgiveness and catharsis that concludes
      this complex saga with mixed notes of sadness and hope.

      <h3>From Bookmarks Magazine</h3>
      <p>
        Reviewers of science fiction and fantasy novels tend to
      respect authors who wrap up a series neatly rather than
      spinning out endless sequels. But they also demand good
      endings, which may be why expectations for Abraham's
        <em>The Price of Spring</em>
        were so high. The book generally
      met them; critics were pleased to see that Abraham could
      settle all the questions raised in the earlier novels without
      losing any of his innovative edge. Several reviewers felt
      that
        <em>The Price of Spring</em>
        was the best book in the series;
      Jo Walton (in an independent review on Tor.com, a Web site
      run by the book's publisher) wrote that it is "the fastest
      moving and most exciting of all the volumes."
