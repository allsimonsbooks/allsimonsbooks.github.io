<p>
<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<h3 xmlns="">Amazon.com Review</h3>
<p>
    
<em>The Wise Man's Fear</em> continues the mesmerizing slow
    reveal of the story of Kvothe the Bloodless, an orphaned actor
    who became a fearsome hero before banishing himself to a tiny
    town in the middle of Newarre. The readers of Patrick
    Rothfuss's outstanding first book, 
    <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em> makes up day two, and uncovers
    enough to satisfy readers and make them desperate for the full
    tale, from Kvothe's rapidly escalating feud with Ambrose to the
    shockingly brutal events that mark his transformation into a
    true warrior, and to his encounters with Felurian and the Adem.
    Rothfuss remains a remarkably adept and inventive storyteller,
    and Kvothe's is a riveting tale about a boy who becomes a man
    who becomes a hero and a killer, spinning his own mythology out
    of the ether until he traps himself within it. Drop everything
    and read these books.

<strong>Author One-on-One: Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon
    Sanderson</strong>
    
<br>
    
<em>The Wise Man's Fear</em>) and</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Author Q&amp;A with Patrick Rothfuss</strong>
    
</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: Your first novel, 
      <em>The Name of the Wind</em> introduces the hero (or some
      may say anti-hero) Kvothe as a larger-than-life living
      legend.</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: I don't know if I'd call him larger-than-life. His
    reputation is larger-than-life, certainly. The man himself is
    remarkably life-sized. I think that's part of the reason people
    like him.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: How did you create him?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: I got the idea for Kvothe after I finished reading
    Cyranno De Bergerac for the first time. I was completely
    knocked over by that character. He was passionate, arrogant,
    witty, clever, a fighter, a poet, a philosopher. He was
    compelling and interesting, and a bit of a bastard, but you
    loved him and felt sorry for him. I remember thinking, "Why
    haven't I ever read a fantasy novel with a character this
    good?"</p>
<p>Shortly after that I read Casanova's memoirs. That's when I
    realized that autobiography could be really compelling so long
    as the person's life is exciting, and their personality is
    interesting.</p>
<p>Those two things might not have been the seed for the book,
    they were certainly around when the seed was sprouting....</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: What contemporary superhero would you put Kvothe
      up against?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Batman.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: Who would win?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Ah hell. If we're talking about Kvothe as he appears in
    the second book. Batman would probably come out on top. I'd say
    Kvothe would only have about a 30% chance of pulling off the
    win there.</p>
<p>But even if Batman did win, he'd walk away with a limp.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: Kvothe leads readers through the entire
      series&mdash;from the storytelling, to the action, to the
      inner monologue. Are there any similarities between Kvothe
      and yourself?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: A few. But less than people typically think. People are
    always saying, "Why do you hate poets so much?" I have to
    remind them that Kvothe is the one with that particular
    grudge.</p>
<p>But yeah. There are a few similarities. We both have the bad
    habit of expressing ourselves freely and clearly when it would
    be better to keep our mouths shut.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: Fans love the books and are fascinated by the
      characters, but you&rsquo;ve also garnered a cult-like
      following. Can you tell us what that&rsquo;s like?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: I've got a cult? That's awesome. Do they have robes and
    stuff? Do we have baccanals? We better have baccanals. If I
    have cult it better old-school. Dionysian. Orgiastic. If I find
    out they're just drinking tang and handing out pamphlets on
    streetcorners I'm going to be pissed.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: When did you realize that you wanted to become a
      writer?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: I&rsquo;ve known I wanted to be a writer for a long time.
    Since forever. I started my first fantasy novel when I was 15
    or so. It wasn&rsquo;t very good, of course. In fact, it was
    horrible. Beyond horrible. It had cat-man samurai in it. I'm
    not even kidding. But it was a good learning experience. The
    mistakes I made in that novel taught me a lot about writing.
    Generally speaking, our failures teach us more than our
    successes. Part of the reason 
    <em>The Name of the Wind</em> turned out so good is because I
    made so many rookie mistakes in that first, horrible novel.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: Did any of your experiences in college influence
      some of the scenes at the University?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: No. Not really. You're making that whole Pat/Kvothe
    mistake again. He's the one with the red hair. I'm the one with
    the beard.</p>
<p>A lot of people assume that because I spent 11 years in
    college, I based the University off my experiences as a
    student. It's a reasonable thought, but it couldn't be further
    from the truth. It wouldn't have taken me nearly so long to
    write this book I was just stealing things out of the real
    world.</p>
<p>The truth is, I find stories that are thinly-veiled
    autobiography pretty tiresome. Authors inevitably put something
    of themselves into a book, but that doesn't mean you should
    turn your 3rd grade math teacher into a villain in a desperate
    attempt to get revenge. I've read books like that in the past.
    They're terrible.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: What was the best class you took in all that
      time?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Basic Critical Thinking. This is usually taught as a
    philosophy class at most universities, but in my opinion it
    should be required for every college student.</p>
<p>You see, everyone assumes they know how to think rationally,
    but most people don't. We are emotional, messy-headed
    creatures. And even very clever, well-informed people can be
    very stupid when it comes to dealing with things in a rational,
    critical way.</p>
<p>I've had people try to have arguments with me. They say
    things like, "What you have to realize is that logically..."
    and then they spout off the most ridiculous bullshit. They
    don't know what logic is. They think that if they feel strongly
    about something, it's logic. They think if they grew up
    believing it, it's logic.</p>
<p>I had a guy try to convince me that ESP was real because he
    was thinking about his girlfriend before the phone rang. Not
    only was he sure he was right, but he was absolutely certain
    that he was providing a crushing argument. He felt unassailable
    in his reasoning.</p>
<p>All I could think was, 
    <em>'Sweet baby Jesus. That's a post hoc fallacy. You're trying
    to convince me using faulty logic that Aristotle was making fun
    of over 2000 years ago.'</em> Maybe that shit works in whatever
    N-sync chatroom you grew up in. But don't bring it round here.
    Here we have rational discourse. You want to sit at the
    grown-up table, you learn the rules.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: The structure of your story is different than most
      fantasy novels. Why did you choose to write your book that
      way?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Everyone always seems so surprised by the framed story,
    but it isn't anything new. 
    <em>The Princess Bride</em> is a framed tale. 
    <em>The Arabian Nights</em> is a framed tale.... 
    <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> is a... well... it's half a framed
    tale.</p>
<p>As for the first person, it&rsquo;s the most natural form of
    storytelling there is. When you tell your friend a story, you
    say, "I almost got hit by a truck today.&rdquo; You don't hide
    behind third person.</p>
<p>Yeah. Sure. Most novels are written a different way.
    Tradition. The Aristotelian unities. Three act structure. What
    do I care about that? I'm not doing a paint-by-numbers here.
    I'm not doing a connect-the-dots. I&rsquo;m looking to tell a
    different type of story here. I'll do it my way.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: The first edition of 
      <em>The Name of the Wind</em> was released in 2007. What
      kinds of projects have you been involved with over the past 3
      years, besides writing 
      <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em>, the long-awaited and highly
      anticipated sequel?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Let's see...</p>
<p>I started a charity called Worldbuilders. Fantasy authors
    and publishers donate books that we use to encourage people to
    donate to Heifer International. In the last three years we've
    raised over half a million dollars for Heifer
    International.</p>
<p>I also wrote a not-for-children picture book illustrated by
    my friend Nate Taylor. It turned out amazing. I think of it as 
    <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> meets 
    <em>Coraline</em> meets Edward Gorey.</p>
<p>Oh. And I had a baby. Does that count as a project? I think
    it counts as a project.</p>
<p>
      
<strong>Q: What&rsquo;s next for Kvothe and the Kingkiller
      Chronicle?</strong>
    
</p>
<p>A: Explosions. Gunfights. Moonlit swordfights across
    rooftops. Johnny Depp. Naked supermodels. Kung-fu. Car chases.
    A thousand elephants.</p>
<p>Actually, that's all a lie. I don't believe in spoilers.</p>
<p>Still, I think it's safe to say that Kvothe grows up a bit
    in the second book. There's a big difference between the story
    of a young boy and the story of a young man. It wouldn't be
    realistic to have twelve-year-old Kvothe doing much
    swashbuckling. But sixteen-year-old Kvothe? Yeah. It's safe to
    say that he'll be buckling a little swash.</p>
<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
<p>Starred Review. As seamless and lyrical as a song from the
    lute-playing adventurer and arcanist Kvothe, this mesmerizing
    sequel to Rothfuss's 2007's debut, The Name of the Wind, is a
    towering work of fantasy. As Kvothe, now the unassuming keeper
    of the Waystone Inn, continues to share his astounding life
    story&mdash;a history that includes saving an influential lord
    from treachery, defeating a band of dangerous bandits, and
    surviving an encounter with a legendary Fae seductress&mdash;he
    also offers glimpses into his life's true pursuit: figuring out
    how to vanquish the mythical Chandrian, a group of seven
    godlike destroyers that brutally murdered his family and left
    him an orphan. But while Kvothe recalls the events of his past,
    his future is conspiring just outside the inn's doors. This
    breathtakingly epic story is heartrending in its intimacy and
    masterful in its narrative essence, and will leave fans waiting
    on tenterhooks for the final installment. (Mar.)
