      <strong>Summary</strong>

      <sup>
        "You're not children anymore," a desperate Kit Snicket
      tells Violet, Klaus and Sunny in the opening pages of Lemony
      Snicket's THE PENULTIMATE PERIL. "You're volunteers, ready to
      face the challenges of a desperate and perplexing world."
      Indeed, in this adventure the profoundly unlucky Baudelaire
      orphans face dilemmas more perplexing and desperate than any
      they've faced in the previous eleven books in A Series of
      Unfortunate Events.
        <br />
        Now that they've reached the Hotel Denouement, the
      hapless siblings must pose as concierges, heavily disguised
      to protect their identities, and discern the true motives and
      identities of the hotel's many mysterious guests. Indeed,
      during their explorations of the massive hotel, the
      Baudelaires encounter characters from nearly every one of
      their previous misadventures (including that cakesniffer
      Carmelita and the always "in" Esme Squalor).
        <br />
        The Hotel Denouement is full of secrets, able to be
      unlocked only by those who really understand the Dewey
      Decimal System. From the rooftop sunbathing deck to the
      laundry room, the Baudelaires try to sort out the volunteers
      from the villains, hoping against hope that they're not
      "wrong, wrong, wrong."
        <br />
        Lemony Snicket's twelfth book lacks none of the verbal
      wit and clever snarkiness that have made this series so
      popular. Indeed, now that youngest sibling Sunny is speaking
      more clearly, her dialogue contributes even more to the
      clever wordplay at which these books excel. Some surprising
      secrets are in store, as well as a real cliffhanger of an
      ending, which promises to make the series much more complex
      than anyone would have imagined.
        <br />
        Even though Lemony Snicket would tell you to toss THE
      PENULTIMATE PERIL into the nearest puddle or pond, it's
      definitely worth keeping up with the ongoing saga of the
      world's most trouble-prone siblings. The only unfortunate
      thing will be the wait for the series's final
      installment!
