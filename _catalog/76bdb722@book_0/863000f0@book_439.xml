      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 8 in the Dresden Files series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>The White Council of Wizards has drafted Harry Dresden as
      a Warden and assigned him to look into rumors of black magic
      in Chicago. Malevolent entities that feed on fear are loose
      in the Windy City, but it's all in a day's work for a wizard,
      his faithful dog, and a talking skull named Bob.</p>
      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Harry Dresden, Chicago's only consulting wizard, takes on
      phobophages, creatures that feed on fear who attack a horror
      film convention, in the diverting eighth installment of
      Butcher's increasingly complicated Dresden Files series (
        <em>Dead Beat</em>
        , etc.). Harry finds that fighting monsters
      is only the prelude to maneuvers amid the warring wizards of
      the White Council and the vampire Red Court. Less and less
      V.I. Warshawski with witchcraft, Harry aims his deductive
      powers at political intrigues rather than crime solving. The
      body count from the magical melees, however, would do any
      hard-boiled gumshoe proud. Butcher's believable, likable set
      of characters go for the jocular much more than the jugular.
      Deeper fears do run through the book, and Harry, taking on an
      apprentice, has to face up to the consequences of his
      all-too-human failings. Look for the series to really take
      off with the debut of a two-hour pilot on the Sci-Fi Channel
      this summer produced by Nicholas Cage.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        The second Dresden Files hardcover finds Chicago wizard
      Harry Dresden assigned an unpleasant task by the White
      Council of Wizards. He has to find out where the Winter Fairy
      Court stands in the White Council's war against the vampires.
      To make matters worse, he has gotten a missive from a
      powerful wizard claiming someone is using black magic in
      Chicago. It doesn't take long for Harry to pinpoint the
      source of the problem. Molly, the daughter of a close friend,
      comes to him for help after her boyfriend is accused of
      attacking an elderly theater owner at a horror-movie
      convention. When another attack occurs and Harry sees the
      dangerous type of magic used, he knows he is dealing with a
      very serious threat indeed. Butcher is in fine form here, and
      with the Sci Fi channel in the process of turning the first
      Dresden Files novel,
        <em>Storm Front</em>
        (2000), into a TV movie, expect the
      series' audience to grow.
