      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">From an extraordinary new voice in
    fantasy comes the stunning conclusion to the Farseer trilogy,
    as FitzChivalry confronts his destiny as the catalyst who holds
    the fate of the kingdom of the Six Duchies...and the world
    itself.King Shrewd is dead at the hands of his son Regal. As is
    Fitz--or so his enemies and friends believe. But with the help
    of his allies and his beast magic, he emerges from the grave,
    deeply scarred in body and soul. The kingdom also teeters
    toward ruin: Regal has plundered and abandoned the capital,
    while the rightful heir, Prince Verity, is lost to his mad
    quest--perhaps to death. Only Verity's return--or the heir his
    princess carries--can save the Six Duchies.But Fitz will not
    wait. Driven by loss and bitter memories, he undertakes a
    quest: to kill Regal. The journey casts him into deep waters,
    as he discovers wild currents of magic within him--currents
    that will either drown him or make him something more than he
    was....</p>
