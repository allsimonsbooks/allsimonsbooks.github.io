<strong>Series: </strong>Book 4 in the Ender Saga series</p>
<p>
<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p xmlns="">Children of the Mind Orson Scott Card returns at last to the
    story of Ender Wiggin, the child hero of the Hugo and Nebula
    award winner Ender's Game, who as a man found a way to redeem
    the Xenocide of his youth and restore the Hive Queen to life.
    Now his adopted world, Lusitania, is threatened by the same
    planet-destroying weapon that he himself used so many thousands
    of years before. Lusitania is home to three sentient species:
    The Pequeninos, a strange race native to Lusitania; a large
    colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender.
    But the Starways Congress fears Lusitania and a strange virus
    that it harbors, and they have gathered a fleet to destroy the
    planet. Ender's oldest friend, Jane, the computer intelligence
    that has evolved with him over three thousand years, allowed
    the Starways Congress to discover her existence when she tried
    t stop the fleet. Now they are trying to kill her as well, by
    shutting down the network of computers and ansibles in which
    she lives. They are afraid of her and of her control over all
    human communications. Jane can save the three sentient races of
    Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the
    universe, and then instantly back to a different world,
    abolishing the light-speed limit. But it takes all the
    processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is
    shutting down the Net world by world. Soon she will not be able
    to move the ships. But there is hope: during the first trip
    outside, Ender's mind briefly took control and created two new
    beings - replicas of his brother Peter, who was the Hegemon,
    and his sister Valentine. These two children of Ender's mind,
    together with his adopted children from Lusitania, are racing
    against time to discover new worlds, to influence the Starways
    Congress to recall the fleet, and to save Jane by finding a
    home for her disembodied intelligence once the Human Network is
    closed off to her.</p>
