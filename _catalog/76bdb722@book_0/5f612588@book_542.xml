      Book 1 in the Night Angel Trilogy series
    </p>

      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      For Durzo Blint, assassination is an art-and he is the
    city's most accomplished artist.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      For Azoth, survival is precarious. Something you never take
    for granted. As a guild rat, he's grown up in the slums, and
    learned to judge people quickly - and to take risks. Risks like
    apprenticing himself to Durzo Blint.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">But to be accepted, Azoth must turn his back on his old life
    and embrace a new identity and name. As Kylar Stern, he must
    learn to navigate the assassins' world of dangerous politics
    and strange magics - and cultivate a flair for death.</p>
    <h3 xmlns="">Review</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      "What a terrific story! I was mesmerized from start to
    finish. Unforgettable characters, a plot that kept me guessing,
    non-stop action and the kind of in-depth storytelling that
    makes me admire a writer's work." --- Terry Brooks
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">"Kylar is a wonderful character - sympathetic and
    despicable, cowardly and courageous, honorable and
    unscrupulous...a breathtaking debut!" --- Dave Duncan</p>
    <h3 xmlns="">About the Author</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      Brent Weeks was born and raised in Montana. After getting
    his paper keys from Hillsdale College, Brent had brief stints
    walking the earth like Caine from
      <em>Kung Fu</em>
      , tending bar, and corrupting the youth. (Not
    at the same time.) He started writing on bar napkins, then on
    lesson plans, then full time. Eventually, someone paid him for
    it. Brent lives in Oregon with his wife, Kristi. He doesn't own
    cats or wear a ponytail. Find out more about the author at
