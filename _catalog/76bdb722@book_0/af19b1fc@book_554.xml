    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>From the author of Legion and the #1 New York Times
      bestselling Stormlight Archive comes an action-filled novella
      about privilege, culture clash, and expectations.</p>
      <p>God-Emperor Kairominas is lord of all he surveys. He has
      defeated all foes, has united the entire world beneath his
      rule, and has mastered the arcane arts. He spends his time
      sparring with his nemesis, who keeps trying to invade Kai's
      world.</p>
      <p>Except for today. Today, Kai has to go on a date.</p>
      <p>Forces have conspired to require him to meet with his
      equalâ€”a woman from another world who has achieved just
      as much as he has. What happens when the most important man
      in the world is forced to have dinner with the most important
      woman in the world?</p>
