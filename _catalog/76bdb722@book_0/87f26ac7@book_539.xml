      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Logan Gyre is king of Cenaria, a country under siege, with a
    threadbare army and little hope. He has one chance - a
    desperate gamble, but one that could destroy his kingdom.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      In the north, the new Godking has a plan. If it comes to
    fruition, no one will have the power to stop him.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Kylar Stern has no choice. To save his friends-and perhaps
    his enemies-he must accomplish the impossible: assassinate a
    goddess.
      <br />
      <em>
        <br />
        Beyond the Shadows
      </em>
      is the action-packed conclusion to the
    Night Angel Trilogy.

    <h3 xmlns="">About the Author</h3>
    <p xmlns="">
      Brent Weeks was born and raised in Montana. After getting
    his paper keys from Hillsdale College, Brent had brief stints
    walking the earth like Caine from
      <em>Kung Fu</em>
      , tending bar, and corrupting the youth. (Not
    at the same time.) He started writing on bar napkins, then on
    lesson plans, then full time. Eventually, someone paid him for
    it. Brent lives in Oregon with his wife, Kristi. He doesn't own
    cats or wear a ponytail. Find more about the author at
    www.brentweeks.com.
