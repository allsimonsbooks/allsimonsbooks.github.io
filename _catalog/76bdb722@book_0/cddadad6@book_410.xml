      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        One hundred years before
        <em>Ender's Game</em>
        , the aliens arrived on Earth with fire
      and death. This is the story of the First Formic War.
      </p>
      <p>Victor Delgado beat the alien ship to Earth, but just
      barely. Not soon enough to convince skeptical
      governments that there was a threat. They didn’t
      believe that until space stations and ships and colonies went
      up in sudden flame.</p>
      <p>And when that happened, only Mazer Rackham and the Mobile
      Operations Police could move fast enough to meet the
      threat.</p>
      <p>
        Fans of
        <em>Ender's Game</em>
        will thrill to Orson Scott Card and
      Aaron Johnston's
        <em>Earth Afire</em>

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>Starred Review. With a stellar cast of narrators, this
      prequel to Card's sci-fi classic Ender's Game is a
      rollicking, rollercoaster ride of an adventure. Set more than
      100 years before the events of the Ender Quintet, this second
      part of the trilogy describes the beginning of the Formic
      war. With a brutal invasion that catches Earth by surprise,
      the Formics establish a strong foothold in China and proceed
      to rain death and destruction on the planet. A diverse group
      of people, including both military personnel and civilians,
      struggles for survival and endeavors to fight back against
      the invading hoard. From the very beginning of this audio
      edition, the almost-nonstop action is delivered perfectly,
      keeping listeners on the edge of their seats. At the same
      time, the narrators manage to bring a large and diverse cast
      of characters to life with a sharply realized array of
      distinct voices and accents. The standout performance belongs
      to Stefan Rudnicki, who offers up a pitch-perfect rendition
      of Mazer Rackham, a New Zealand special ops officer, as he,
      along with a young refugee, labors across a war-torn Chinese
      countryside toward a nail-biting showdown with the invaders.
      The audiobook ends on a major cliffhanger, leaving listeners
      chomping at the bit for the next installment. A Tor
      hardcover. (June)</p>
