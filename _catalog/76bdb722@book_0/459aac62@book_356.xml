      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 5 in the Dark Tower series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Roland Deschain and his "ka-tet" are bearing southeast
    through the forests of Mid-World, the almost timeless landscape
    that seems to stretch from the wreckage of civility that
    defined Roland's youth to the crimson chaos that seems the
    future's only promise. Readers of Stephen King's epic series
    know Roland well, or as well as this enigmatic hero can be
    known. They also know the companions who have been drawn to his
    quest for the Dark Tower: Eddie Dean and his wife, Susannah;
    Jake Chambers, the boy who has come twice through the doorway
    of death into Roland's world; and Oy, the Billy-Bumbler. In
    this long-awaited fifth novel in the saga, their path takes
    them to the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis, a tranquil valley
    community of farmers and ranchers on Mid-World's borderlands.
    Beyond the town, the rocky ground rises toward the hulking
    darkness of Thunderclap, the source of a terrible affliction
    that is slowly stealing the community's soul. One of the town's
    residents is Pere Callahan, a ruined priest who, like Susannah,
    Eddie, and Jake, passed through one of the portals that lead
    both into and out of Roland's world. As Father Callahan tells
    the "ka-tet" the astonishing story of what happened following
    his shamed departure from Maine in 1977, his connection to the
    Dark Tower becomes clear, as does the danger facing a single
    red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown
    Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis, danger gathers in the east
    like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their
    unspeakable depredation are coming. To resist them is to risk
    all, but these are odds the gunslingers are used to, and they
    can give the "Calla-folken" both courage and cunning. Their
    guns, however, will not be enough.</p>
