          New in hardcover from the #1

          bestselling author of the Dresden
        Files series.

        For Harry Dresden, there have been worse assignments than
      going undercover on the set of an adult film. Still, there's
      something more troubling than usual about his newest case.
      The film's producer believes he's the target of a sinister
      curse-but it's the women around him who are dying.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry's even more frustrated because he only got involved
      with this bizarre mystery as a favor to Thomas-his
      flirtatious, self-absorbed vampire acquaintance of dubious
      integrity. Thomas has a personal stake in the case Harry
      can't quite figure out. But Harry is about to discover that
      Thomas' family tree has been hiding a shocking revelation
      that will change his life forever...
        <br />

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        Per usual, wizard-detective extraordinaire Harry Dresden
      is in trouble. He barely escapes an assassination attempt,
      courtesy of the Black Council of vampires, when Thomas, a
      vampire who has helped Harry out on occasion, asks him to
      take a case. It seems someone doesn't want porno film
      director Arturo Genosa's latest effort to get off the ground.
      An entropy spell has killed two of Arturo's assistants, and
      Thomas wants Harry to find the culprit. With suspects
      abounding--Arturo has no fewer than three ex-wives--Harry
      decides to pose as a production assistant at the studio.
      Though he isn't able to stop another sabotage attempt, this
      one threatening an actress' life, he does save the young
      woman. With danger closing in, the last thing Harry needs is
      a sexy succubus and a surprising revelation about his
      heritage. Filled with sizzling magic and intrigue as well as
      important developments for Harry, the latest of his
      adventures will have fans rapidly turning the pages.
