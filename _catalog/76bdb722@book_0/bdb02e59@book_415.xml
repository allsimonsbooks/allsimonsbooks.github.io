      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">In Shadow Puppets, Orson Scott Card continues the storyline
    of Shadow of the Hegemon, following the exploits of the Battle
    School children, prodigies who have returned to an Earth thrown
    into chaos after the unifying force of the alien invasion they
    stopped in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow has dissipated.
    Foremost among these whiz kids is the brilliant Bean who, in
    Shadow of the Hegemon, rescued his comrades from his
    nemesis--the dastardly Achilles. Now, the down-but-not-out evil
    genius is again scheming towards global domination and
    vengeance against the irrepressible Bean. It's up to Bean and
    his newfound love, Petra, to outwit the young psychopath and
    save the world. Meanwhile, the other Battle School children are
    called to serve again as an expansionist China threatens the
    stability of post-Bugger War Earth. Shadow Puppets is, for
    better or worse, exactly what readers have come to expect from
    Card. There are thought-provoking musings on geopolitics, war,
    courage, arrogance, good versus evil, and the concept of
    children wise beyond their years dealing with grave
    responsibility. Unfortunately, many of these furnishings are
    looking a little frayed around the edges, but fans will enjoy
    an exciting, fast-paced plot and a suspense-filled conclusion.
