      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>A century has passed since the heroic defence of Dros
      Delnoch. But the people of the Drenai face a new terror: a
      mad emperor kept in power by two forces of unsurpassed evil.
      The Joinings are werebeasts of awesome power. The Dark
      Templars are warrior-priests whose fighting skills are
      without equal. Against them, the Drenai face certain defeat.
      One man, an outsider hated by the Drenai for his Nadir blood,
      and despised by the Nadir for his Drenai ancestry, sets out
      to bring down the emperor. He is one man against the armies
      of chaos. He is Tenaka Khan - the Prince of Shadows.</p>

      McCaffrey Has pace, conviction and gritty resolute
      vitality...The result is a book that will be enjoyed by

      manages to take a familiar, generic scenario and infuse it
      with meaning...it's a thoughtful genre fantasy, a bit chewier
      than most, and quite, quite tasty LOCUS</p>
