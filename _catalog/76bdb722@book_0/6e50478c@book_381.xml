      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">The gods of Olympus are alive in the
    21st Century. They still fall in love with mortals and have
    children who might become great heroes, but most of these
    children meet horrible fates at the hands of monsters by the
    age of twelve. Only a few learn the truth of their identity and
    make it to Half Blood Hill, a Long Island summer camp dedicated
    to training young demigods. Such is the revelation that
    launches young Percy Jackson on a quest to help his real
    father, Poseidon, avert a war among the gods. With the help of
    Grover the satyr and Annabeth the daughter of Athena, Percy
    must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has
    stolen the original weapon of mass destruction - Zeus master
    bolt. Along the way, they face a host of mythological enemies
    determined to stop them. Most of all, Percy must come to terms
    with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned
    him of betrayal by a friend.</p>
