<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
      
<p>Over and again, the aged seeress Tamis scried all the
      possible tomorrows. In every one, dark forces threatened
      Greece; terrible evil was poised to reenter the world. The
      future held only one hope: a half-caste Spartan boy,
      Parmenion. So Tamis made it her mission to see that Parmenion
      would before the deadliest warrior in the world -- no matter
      what the cost.
      <br>Raised to manhood in Sparta, bullied and forced to
      fight for his life every day, Parmenion had no notion of the
      unseen dimensions of magic and mystery that shaped his fate.
      He grew in strength and cunning. His military genius earned
      him the title Strategos in Sparta. His triumphs for the city
      of Thebes made him a hero. And finally his fate led him to
      the service of Philip of Macedon.
      <br>As Tamis had foreseen, Parmenion's destiny was tied to
      the Dark God, to Philip, and to the yet-unborn Alexander. All
      too soon the future was upon them. Parmenion stood poised to
      defeat evil -- or to open the gate for the Dark God to
      reenter the world.

<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      
<p>This enjoyable historical fantasy set in ancient Greece
      spans three decades in the career of Parmenion, a Spartan of
      mixed ancestry whose life is being shaped and monitored by an
      aging seeress. Scorned as a half-breed by the Spartans, he
      leaves vowing to wreak vengeance--which he does, at the head
      of a victorious Theban ar- my. Parmenion goes on to become
      Greece's preeminent soldier of fortune, a brilliant military
      strategist and tactician. Eventually, he hires on to Philip,
      the beleaguered king of Macedonia. Parmenion provides the
      young king with military help but, more importantly,
      intervenes in a ceremony meant to secure the siring of a
      child whose birth might signal the ultimate triumph of evil.
      Parmenion's final--and most meaningful--battle takes place
      not in this world but in Hades, where the forces of evil are
      held at bay long enough to deny the Dark God dominion over
      the newly born soul of Alexander the Great. Particularly
      enchanting in Gemmell's ( Legend ) ambitious book is the
      appearance of Aristotle as a wizard and guide through the
      underworld, a Greek combination of Arthur's Merlin and
      Dante's Virgil.

<h3>From Library Journal</h3>
      
<p>An ancient seeress foresees the rise of a dark god whose
      rule will mean destruction and whose future is linked, for
      good or ill, with a half-Spartan, half-Macedonian warrior
      named Parmenion. Pre-Alexandrian Greece provides a rich
      background for Gemmell's novel of magic and destiny as
      Parmenion defies the fates to become the right-hand man of
      Philip of Macedon and plays his part in the struggle against
      the forces of chaos. Fans of ancient history will enjoy this
      mythic adventure.
