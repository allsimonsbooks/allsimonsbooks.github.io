      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">Arriving at Dark Avenue, the three
    Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and little Sunny, begin their
    new life with Jerome and Esme Squalor. Jerome is a kind man,
    but he agrees unquestioningly with everything said by his wife,
    who is the city's sixth most important financial advisor. The
    Baudelaires find themselves in a strange world of in things:
    aqueous martinis (consisting of water with an olive), pinstripe
    suits (even for infant Sunny) and meals only involving salmon.
    Sadly, elevators are out, and the children are obliged to walk
    the many steps up to the Squalors' penthouse. Even more sadly,
    they soon meet Count Olaf again, disguised as the auctioneer
    Gunther, and discover that the ersatz elevator is not an
    elevator at all, but a shaft in which the Quagmire triplets are
    imprisoned. When they tell Esme of the triplets' fate, she
    shocks them by throwing them down the elevator too and
    revealing herself to be in league with Count Olaf. Sunny
    manages to escape using her teeth, and help her siblings out,
    who run down the ersatz passageway to emerge - in a spectacular
    climax - in the charred remains of their parents' mansion! With
    no time to reflect, they run to Esme's In Auction, hoping to
    save the Quagmires, but Esme and Olaf escape with the triplets,
    and the Baudelaires are once more left with only each other to
    rely on</p>
