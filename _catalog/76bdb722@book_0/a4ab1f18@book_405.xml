      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Peggy is a Torch, able to see the fire burning in each
      person's heart. She can follow the paths of each person's
      future, and know each person's most intimate secrets. From
      the moment of Alvin Maker's birth, when the Unmaker first
      strove to kill him, she has protected him.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now they are married, and Peggy is a part of Alvin's heart
      as well as his life.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But Alvin's destiny has taken them on separate journeys.
      Alvin has gone north into New England, where knacks are
      considered witchcraft, and their use is punished with death.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Peggy has been drawn south, to the British Crown Colonies
      and the court of King Arthur Stuart in exile. For she has
      seen a terrible future bloom in the heartfires of every
      person in America, a future of war and destruction. One
      slender path exists that leads through the bloodshed, and it
      is Peggy's quest to set the world on the path to peace.
