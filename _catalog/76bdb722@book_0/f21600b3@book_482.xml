      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">Centuries ago, Connavar's triumphant
    battles against the invading army of Stone gained the Rigante
    their freedom, yet magic that once flourished has been all but
    snuffed out. The Varlish king and his barons have stolen
    Rigante lands and robbed the people of their culture and
    liberty. From the Rigante's former seat of power the
    blackhearted Moidart rules; only in the north are the clansmen
    free. There, in the Druagh mountains, the magic still reigns,
    strengthened by bold, brilliant victories of the outlaw leader
    known as Ravenheart.One glorious spark, one moment of Rigante
    rebellion, has ignited a revolution and forged a legend. The
    conquered clans set about to redicover their greatness - yet
    theirs is not the only call to arms. In the south, civil war
    has drenched the land in blood, and the armies of destruction
    have been creeping north. There the brooding Ravenheart waits,
    believing the forces of the hated Moidart will come, led by the
    brutal ruler's only son, Stormrider.Ravenheart and Stormrider:
    enemies of uncommon courage, are unaware that the fate of the
    world lies in their hands. Faced with this inexorable advance,
    deadly foes will be forced to unite and a secret lost in the
    uncharted past will return to haunt these two warriors as they
    face the vengeance of an ancient evil. Immense armies of
    darkness advance on the highlanders, and it seems as if nothing
    will stop them. They crush their enemies with ease, until only
    a few thousand men stand before them, with no help in sight.But
    these are not ordinary men they face. They are clansmen, and
    more than that, they are Rigante.</p>
