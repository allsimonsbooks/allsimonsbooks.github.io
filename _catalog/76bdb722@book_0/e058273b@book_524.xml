      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">The age-old war was ended at last, and Destiny once again
    rolled on in its proper course. Only a single person remained
    to tell of the near-forgotten times when Gods still walked the
    lands, giving comfort and counsel to their mortal children.
    Only one man alive could speak with certain knowledge of how
    the Dark God Torak stole the Orb of Aldur and broke the very
    world apart, consigning the Gods themselves to the hell of war,
    along with hapless humanity. Only one individual was left who
    could relate the whole, fearsome story. That lone witness to
    history was known to all the world. He was called the Ancient
    One, the Old Wolf - Belgarath the Sorcerer. And he had been a
    part of that history from the beginning. Here, then, is his
    tale in full: the story of the strife that split the world
    asunder and of how the God Aldur and his chosen disciples would
    toil to set Destiny aright - a monumental undertaking fated to
    span the eons. Foremost in the chronicles of that labor would
    be Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was foredoomed to cost him
    the very thing he held most dear - and his loyal service would
    extend on, through the echoing centuries of loss, of struggle,
    and of ultimate triumph.</p>
