      Make no mistake.
      <i>The Bad Beginning</i>
      begins badly for the three Baudelaire
    children, and then gets worse. Their misfortunes begin one gray
    day on Briny Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents
    perished in a fire that destroyed their whole house. "It is
    useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus,
    and even Sunny felt in the time that followed," laments the
    personable (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the
    story as if his readers are gathered around an armchair on
    pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful. The children
    thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them
    grotesque-colored clothing that itched. But when they are
    ushered to the dilapidated doorstep of the miserable, thin,
    unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they know that
    they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still,
    they could never have anticipated how much trouble. While it's
    true that the events that unfold in Lemony Snicket's novels are
    bleak, and things never turn out as you'd hope, these
    delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent
    of Roald Dahl (remember
      <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>
      and his horrid spinster
    aunts), Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip in
      <i>Great Expectations</i>
      without the mysterious benefactor),
    and Edward Gorey (
      <i>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>
      ). There is no question that young
    readers will want to read the continuing unlucky adventures of
    the Baudelaire children in
      <i>The Reptile Room</i>
      and
      <i>The Wide Window</i>
      . (Ages 9 and older)
