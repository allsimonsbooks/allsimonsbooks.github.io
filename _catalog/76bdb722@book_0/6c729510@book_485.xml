      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 2 in the Rigante series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Bane the Bastard is the illegitimate son of the Rigante
      king who men called Demonblade. Born of treachery, Bane grew
      up an outcast in his own land, feared by his fellow
      highlanders, and denied by the father whose unmistakable mark
      he bore–the eyes of Connavar, one tawny brown, the
      other emerald green.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Hounded from the country of his birth, Bane found
      acceptance across the seas–only to have it stripped
      away in an instant by a cruel and deadly swordsman. Now
      fighting as a gladiator in the blood-soaked arenas of the
      Empire, Bane lives for one thing: revenge. And he pursues his
      goal with the same single-minded determination that won his
      father a crown.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>But more is at stake than a young warrior’s quest
      for vengeance. The armies of the Stone are preparing to march
      on the lands of the Rigante. The fate of human and Seidh
      alike will be decided by the clash of swords–and by the
      bonds of twisted love and bitterness between a father and a
      son . . .</p>
      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        Following
        <em>Sword in the Storm</em>
        ,
        <em>Midnight Falcon</em>
        is David Gemmell's second novel in
      the Rigante sequence. This volume can stand alone, though the
      series will be more accessible if read in order.
      </p>
      <p>Seventeen-year-old Bane, illegitimate son of King
      Connovar, comes to the city of Stone, a place of gladiatorial
      combat, corruption, and religious terror. Embittered by his
      father's refusal to acknowledge him, Bane's wildness leads to
      bloodshed before friendship and betrayal force him to accept
      the complexities of power and responsibility. The novel
      builds to an epic climax, as Bane must accept who he is in
      order to lead his people in a desperate battle for their very
      survival.</p>
      <p>
        David Gemmell has created a detailed and realistic world
      in which the action is vividly described and often thrilling.
      Yet there is a melancholy tone, for the author is as
      concerned with the consequences of war and the nature of men
      of violence as he is with conflict itself. There is a sense
      of the tragedy of war, lending the sad grandeur of history to
      a strongly characterized and intelligent adventure. It is
      something the series has in common with Stephen King's
      haunting fantasy western epic
        <em>The Dark Tower</em>
        .
