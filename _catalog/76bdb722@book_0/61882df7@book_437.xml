        Harry Dresden?s life finally seems to be calming
      down?until a shadow from the past returns. Mab, monarch of
      the Sidhe Winter Court, calls in an old favor from Harry?one
      small favor that will trap him between a nightmarish foe and
      an equally deadly ally, and that will strain his skills?and
      loyalties?to their very limits.

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        Intricate yet accessible plotting and near-Arctic winter
      weather mark the 10th Harry Dresden adventure from bestseller
      Butcher (after 2007's
        <em>White Night</em>
        ). A friendly snowball fight opens the
      Chicago-based wizard-detective's latest tale, but it's not
      long before a host of more dangerous foes are out for Harry's
      blood. A missing human mobster is said to be seeking greater
      influence among Chicago's extranormal population, but the
      true threat proves both more subtle and of much greater
      consequence. Butcher smoothly manages a sizable cast of
      allies and adversaries, doles out needed backstory with crisp
      efficiency and sustains just the right balance of
      hair's-breadth tension and comic relief. Encounters with a
      series of increasingly dangerous Billy Goats Gruff unfold
      with particular cleverness, and key developments involving
      Sgt. Karrin Murphy, Harry's reluctant police liaison, will
      intrigue seasoned fans as well as newcomers attracted by last
      year's TV adaptation of the series.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>Investigating a questionable crime scene, Harry Dresden
      realizes something much nastier than simple arson is
      involved. Then the Winter Queen Mab shows up, requesting one
      of the two favors he still owes her. Soon Harry is embroiled
      in Fae maneuvering and fighting an even nastier enemy, all
      because Mab maneuvered him into helping crime boss Marcone.
      Fortunately, Harry has amazing friends, including some
      characters he hasn’t gotten along with in the past.
      Packed with the epic battling characteristic of the Dresden
      Files, promising something fascinating for the next volume,
      this is another fine combination of mystery and fantasy,
      seasoned by Harry’s appalling sense of humor. --Regina
