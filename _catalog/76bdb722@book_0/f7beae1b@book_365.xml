      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">A heralded writer of epic fantasy, Robin Hobb has given
    readers worlds within worlds in her heroic Farseer and Liveship
    Traders trilogies. Now she takes the final step in the
    breathtaking trilogy of the Tawny Man, as the tale of
    FitzChivalry Farseer comes to an epic end. Rife with boundless
    adventure and unforgettable characters, Fool’s Fate is
    destined to become a classic of the genre.Assassin, spy, and
    Skillmaster, FitzChivalry Farseer, now known only as
    man-at-arms Tom Badgerlock, has become firmly ensconced in the
    queen’s court at Buckkeep. Only a few are aware of his
    fabled, tangled past—and the sacrifices he made to
    survive it. And fewer know of his possession of the Skill
    magic. With Prince Dutiful, his assassin-mentor Chade, and the
    simpleminded yet strongly Skilled Thick, FitzChivalry strives
    to aid the prince on a quest that could ultimately secure peace
    between the Six Duchies and the Outislands—and win
    Dutiful the hand of the Narcheska Elliania. For the Narcheska
    has set the prince on an unfathomable task: to behead a dragon
    trapped in ice—the legendary Icefyre, on the island of
    Aslevjal. Yet not all the clans of the Outislands support the
    prince’s effort to behead their legendary defender. Are
    there darker forces at work behind the Narcheska’s
    imperious demand? As the prince and his coterie set sail,
    FitzChivalry works behind the scenes, playing nursemaid to the
    ailing Thick, while striving to strengthen their
    Skill—ultimately bringing his unacknowledged daughter
    into the web of the Skill magic, where the truth must finally
    unfold.The quest emerges amid riddles that must be unraveled, a
    clash of cultures, and the ultimate betrayal. For knowing that
    the Fool has foretold he will die on the island of ice,
    FitzChivalry has plotted with Chade to leave his dearest friend
    behind. But fate cannot so easily be defied.From the Hardcover
    edition.</p>
