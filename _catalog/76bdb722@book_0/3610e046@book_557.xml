      <strong>Series:</strong>
      Book 4 in the Mistborn series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Fresh from the success of
        <em>The Way of Kings,</em>
        Brandon Sanderson, best known for
      completing Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time®, takes a
      break to return to the world of the bestselling Mistborn
      series.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn
      trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with
      railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the
      streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first
      steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now
      part of history—or religion. Yet even as science and
      technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of
      Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this
      reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs,
      they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting
      to establish order and justice.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can
      Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become
      lighter or heavier at will. After twenty years in the Roughs,
      Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the
      metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his
      guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the
      head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the
      hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of
      the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of
      the Roughs.</p>
      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>
        Praise for the Mistborn series and Brandon Sanderson:
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “ [
        <em>The Hero of Ages</em>
        ] brings the Mistborn epic fantasy
      trilogy to a dramatic and surprising climax....
      Sanderson’s saga of consequences offers complex
      characters and a compelling plot, asking hard questions about
      loyalty, faith, and responsibility.”
        <br />

      <p>
        <em>
          “ Sanderson is an evil genius. There is simply no
      other way to describe what he’s managed to pull off in
      this transcendent final volume of his Mistborn
      trilogy.”

      </p>
      <p>
        *“ It’s rare for a fiction writer to have much
      understanding of how leadership works and how love really
      takes root in the human heart. Sanderson is astonishingly
      wise.”
