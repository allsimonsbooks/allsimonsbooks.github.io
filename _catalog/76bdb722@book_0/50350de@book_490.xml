      Book 2 in the Greek Series series
    </p>

      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        The chaos spirit had chosen the child Alexander to be its
      human host. But Parmenion, most powerful warrior of ancient
      Greece, had won a small victory over the darkness that sought
      to rule through Alexander. The boy's soul had not been
      destroyed by evil, but instead had merged with it -- and now
      Parmenion aided Alexander in the battle between light and
      dark that constantly raged within him.
        <br />
        But there was another world, where the creatures of
      Greece's legends still flourished. There, the chaos spirit
      already ruled, through a demon king. In this Greece, there
      was a prophecy that a child of great power, the legendary
      golden child, would come and restore the fading magic of the
      land to the creatures of myth. The demon king believed also
      that devouring the heart of this fabled child would give him
      immortality. He believed Alexander, with the power of the
      chaos spirit within him, to be that child. And so he called
      Alexander into his world . . .
        <br />
        Only Parmenion, guided by the seeress Derae, his lost
      love from another life, could hope to save Alexander from the
      demon king. But who could save the young prince from the
      chaos spirit that threatened to conquer his soul?

      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        Reading this sequel to
        <em>Lion of Macedon</em>
        is like reading a compressed,
      accelerated
        <em>Lord of the Rings</em>
        crossed with the classic
        <em>Star Trek</em>
        episode, "Mirror, Mirror." Preternaturally
      precocious 4-year-old Alexander is kidnapped by Philippos, a
      demonic parallel-universe twin of King Philip of Macedon.
      Philip's strategos (chief general and strategist), Parmenion,
      and Philip's assassin, Attalus, form an uneasy alliance in
      order to retrieve Alexander. Passed (by the sorcerer
      Aristotle) through a portal to Makedones, a world
      geographically similar to but historically different from
      their own, they must first find Alexander and then make their
      way through hostile, enchanted territory inhabited by magical
      creatures to a rendezvous with Aristotle. But Philip of
      Macedon isn't the only person who has a twin in this parallel
      world, and as Parmenion discovers more about Makedones, he
      finds that the similarities rather than the differences are
      the most troubling.
      </p>
      <p>There are two stories here. First, Alexander's mystic
      quest for redemption (carried out by the chosen few) and
      Parmenion and the Spartans' parallel last-ditch battle
      (fought with ordinary weapons); then, David Gemmell follows
      Alexander and Parmenion home. Although they have beaten a
      horrific demon in Makedones, they have yet to face the demons
      of Macedon: Alexander's life and soul are at stake in another
      battle against darkness.</p>
