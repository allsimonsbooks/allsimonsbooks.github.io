      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">In Heroes Die and Blade of Tyshalle, Matthew Stover created
    a new kind of fantasy novel, and a new kind of hero to go with
    it: Caine, a street thug turned superstar, battling in a future
    where reality shows take place in another dimension, on a world
    where magic exists and gods are up close and personal. In that
    beautiful, savage land, Caine is an assassin without peer, a
    living legend born from one of the highest-rated reality shows
    ever made. That season, Caine almost single-handedly
    defeated–and all but exterminated–the fiercest of
    all tribes: the Black Knives. But the shocking truth of what
    really took place during that blood-drenched adventure has
    never been revealed . . . until now.Thirty years later, Caine
    returns to the scene of his greatest triumph–some would
    say greatest crime–at the request of his adopted brother
    Orbek, the last of the true Black Knives. But where Caine goes,
    danger follows, and he soon finds himself back in familiar
    territory: fighting for his life against impossible odds, with
    the fate of two worlds hanging in the balance. Just the way
    Caine likes it.</p>
