    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        When we last left the mighty wizard detective Harry
      Dresden, he wasn't doing well. In fact, he had been murdered
      by an unknown assassin.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But being dead doesn't stop him when his friends are in
      danger. Except now he has nobody, and no magic to help him.
      And there are also several dark spirits roaming the Chicago
      shadows who owe Harry some payback of their own.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To save his friends-and his own soul-Harry will have to
      pull off the ultimate trick without any magic...
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The eagerly awaited new novel in the #1
        <em>New York Times</em>
        bestselling Dresden Files series.

      <p>A martial arts enthusiast whose resume includes a long

      with his wife, his son and a ferocious guard dog.</p>
