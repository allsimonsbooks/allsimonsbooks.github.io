      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        Harry Dresden is not having a good day. A vampire named
      Ortega is hunting the beleaguered wizard, intending to
      challenge him to a duel that, Ortega claims, will end the war
      between the vampires and the wizards. Harry has almost no
      hope of winning the duel, but soon he is preoccupied by
      another problem: Father Vincent, a priest, needs Harry's help
      in finding the Shroud of Turin, stolen by a trio of thieves.
      Harry traces two of the thieves to his hometown, Chicago, but
      when he finds them, he learns that he isn't the only one
      after them. A group of terrifying demons wants the shroud,
      and its leader is interested in Harry's soul, too. Harry must
      call on all of his friends, including three brave knights,
      his police-officer friend, and even his half-vampire
      ex-girlfriend, Susan. Butcher maintains a breakneck pace in
      Harry's exciting fifth adventure. This imaginative series
      continues to surprise and delight with its inventiveness and
      sympathetic hero.
