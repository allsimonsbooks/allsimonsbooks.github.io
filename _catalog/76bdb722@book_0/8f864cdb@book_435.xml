        The new novel in the #1
        <em>New York Times</em>
        -bestselling Dresden Files.
      </p>
      <p>Long ago, Susan Rodriguez was Harry Dresden's lover-until
      she was attacked by his enemies, leaving her torn between her
      own humanity and the bloodlust of the vampiric Red Court.
      Susan then disappeared to South America, where she could
      fight both her savage gift and those who cursed her with
      it.</p>
      <p>Now Arianna Ortega, Duchess of the Red Court, has
      discovered a secret Susan has long kept, and she plans to use
      it-against Harry. To prevail this time, he may have no choice
      but to embrace the raging fury of his own untapped dark
      power. Because Harry's not fighting to save the world...</p>
      <p>He's fighting to save his child.</p>
      <h3>About the Author</h3>
      <p>A martial arts enthusiast whose resume includes a long
      list of skills rendered obsolete at least two hundred years
      ago, Jim Butcher turned to writing as a career because
      anything else probably would have driven him insane. He lives
      with his wife, his son and a ferocious guard dog.</p>
