      Book 2 in the Troy series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      The second novel in David Gemmell’s bestselling Troy
    trilogy. Interlacing myth and history, and high adventure, this
    is epic storytelling at its very best.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      War is looming, and all the kings of the Great Green are
    gathering, each with their own dark plans of conquest and
    plunder.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Into this maelstrom of treachery come three travellers:
    Piria, a runaway priestess nursing a terrible secret;
    Kalliades, a warrior with high ideals and a legendary sword;
    and his close friend Banokles, who will carve his own legend in
    the battles to come.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Together they journey to the fabled city of Troy, where a
    darkness is falling that will eclipse the triumphs and personal
    tragedies of ordinary mortals for centuries to come.

      Prolific historical novelist Gemmell continues his
    imaginative and addictive Trojan War trilogy with this second
    installment (after
      <em>Troy: Lord of the Silver Bow</em>
      ). While King Agamemnon
    schemes and "dreams of a war with Troy," rival monarch Priam of
    Troy maneuvers to secure his city's future through the marriage
    of his son Hektor to Princess Andromache of Thebe Under Plakos.
    Born with a birthmark resembling the shield of
    Athene—"the Shield of Thunder"—Andromache will,
    according to prophesy, bear the Eagle Child: a king who will
    never be defeated and whose city "will be eternal." Faithful to
    Homeric legend, there is enough intrigue, treachery and
    sanguinary violence to keep readers riveted as Priam publicly
    humiliates King Odysseus of Ithaka, who had hoped to remain
    neutral in the coming conflict. With Odysseus and the demigod
    warrior Achilles among his allies, Agamemnon attacks Troy in a
    war for hegemony. Seamlessly blending legend, mythology and
    history, Gemmell vividly recreates the world of the Greek
    city-states in all of their nobility and pettiness. Lively and
    seductive, this is historical fiction at its page-turning best.

    <p xmlns="">
      Gemmell's Trojan War continues, with Troy now fully under
    siege. The Greeks have their champion in Achilles, a young
    warrior possessed of godlike prowess and self-esteem. In Troy,
    thanks to Athena, Andromache continues to play a larger role
    than that of merely Hector's consort. Greek leader Agamemnon
    has more rank than ability or diplomacy, putting wise Odysseus
    in the awkward position of being sworn to support him while
    foreseeing disaster in his leadership. Characterizations and
    action measure up to Gemmell's usual standards, and since
    highly readable historical action tales are his metier, fans of
    such fare will be pleased.
