      Book 11 in the Drenai series
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Even in death, Skilgannon the Damned’s name lives
      on. Now, as an ancient evil threatens the Drenai heartlands,
      he returns.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A thousand years after they fell in battle, two heroes --
      Druss and Skilgannon -- are revered throughout the war-torn
      lands of the Drenai where men and women live in abject fear
      of the Joinings, abominable meldings of man and beast, and of
      their mistress the dark sorceress known as the Eternal. None
      can stave off these ruthless foes. But what if the soul of a
      hero could be called back from the void, his bones housed
      again in flesh? An ancient prophecy foretold that Skilgannon
      would return in his people’s darkest hour. To most,
      this is a foolish hope, but not so to Landis Kan. For years
      Kan searched for the tomb of Skilgannon the Damned. And at
      last, he found it, gathered up the bones and performed the
      mystic ritual.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But the reborn hero is an enigma; a young man whose
      warrior skills are blunted and whose memories are fragmented.
      This Skilgannon is a man out of time, marooned in a world as
      strange to him as a dream, remote from all he knew and loved.
      Or nearly all. Before bringing Skilgannon back, Landis Kan
      had experimented with other bones in the hero’s tomb.
      That ritual resulted in a surly giant who possessed
      astounding strength, but no memories. To Kan, he is a
      dangerous failure. To Skilgannon, this giant represents their
      last hope.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        As the ageless evil of the Eternal threatens to drown the
      Drenai lands in blood, two legendary heroes rise again.

      <h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      <p>
        In this engrossing science fantasy, the latest in British
      author Gemmell's long-running Drenai series (
        <em>White Wolf</em>
        , etc.), 1,000 years have passed since the
      age of the heroic sword fighter, Skilgannon. A priestly class
      has reawakened ancient technology that allows them to prolong
      life indefinitely, create lycanthropic man-beast combinations
      called Jiamads and fashion magical weapons such as the two
      legendary blades Skilgannon once carried, the Swords of Night
      and Day. The greatest of the priests, Landis Khan, brings
      Skilgannon back to life in order to fight against the arrayed
      armies of another of Landis's resurrections, the empress
      Eternalâ€"aka Queen Jianna, Skilgannon's former
      lover and nemesis. Druss the Legend, the ax-fighter friend of
      Skilgannon from the past, has also been brought back in body.
      Skilgannon and Harad, the clone of Druss, join forces with
      Askari, a clone of Jianna, and various temporal locals, in a
      fight against the Eternal's Mongol-like hordes of
      were-creatures and ravaging soldiers. Though the story brims
      with standard swordplay and unremarkable battle sequences,
      the puzzling out of what a possessed sword might actually be
      (a nanotech-based artificial intelligence?), or how
      resurrection works (bio-engineered cloning?) provides
      delightful diversion and should make this one popular with
      idea-starved fantasy readers.

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        In the latest of the prolific Gemmell's tales of the
      Drenai--a direct sequel to
        <em>White Wolf</em>
        (2002)--the half-animal, half-human
      creations known as the Joinings stalk the land, guided by
      their conquest-mad sorceress mistress, the Eternal, and they
      and their leader are again well developed and more than
      adequately terrifying. Various ancient champions also return
      for this volume, including Druss, who has a new comrade in
      arms, Skilgannon the Damned, who has been dead for a thousand
      years. What with the magical swords these two Barbarossa-like
      figures wield, the already fast and furious action get
      ratcheted up to virtually nonstop for more than two-thirds of
      the book. With that much action, Gemmell is guaranteed to
      hold readers, despite his not-always-top-flight world
      building and sometimes less-than-lucid prose.
