      <i>Probability Math:</i>
      the science of foretelling the future.
      <br />
      <br />
      For Dom Sabalos, heir to an immensely rich family, its
    forecasts were curiously contradictory: he would be
    assassinated, and
      <i>after</i>
      that, find the fabulous, almost mythical, world of
    the Jokers, who were only known by a few incredible artifacts
    scattered throughout the Galaxy.
      <br />
      <br />
      Any good P-Mathematician could find out this information.
    Somebody certainly wanted to prove P-Math wrong as far as Dom
    was concerned, and make sure that once he was dead, he stayed
    dead. A robot assassin, with built-in 'luck', had been put on
    his tail, but what was it that protected Dom every time the
    assassin struck?
      <br />
      <br />
      To be sure, he had an excellent robot servant, Isaac;
    (class 5with Man-Friday subcircuitry),. a planet (the First
    Syrian Bank)as a god-father, a determined and protective
    grandmother (who looked as if she had been born aged eighty), a
    security chief who even ran checks on himself, and a home
    world, where a missing hand was only a minor mishap and even
    death was not always fatal
      <br />
      <br />
      but what protected Dom on his search for the world which
    he knew lay on the dark side of the sun?
