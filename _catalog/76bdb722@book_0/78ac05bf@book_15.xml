      Book 5 in the Series of Unfortunate Events series

    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <i>The Austere Academy</i>
      continues Lemony Snicket's Series of
    Unfortunate Events, the deliciously morbid set of books that
    began with
      <i>The Bad Beginning</i>
      and only got worse.
      <p>
        In
        <i>The Austere Academy</i>
        , Violet, Klaus and Sunny are at
    first optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the
    book-loving trio, and the academy is allegedly safe from the
    dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their fortune. Hope dissipates
    quickly, however, when they meet Vice Principal Nero, a
    self-professed genius violinist who sneeringly imitates their
    every word. More dreadful still, he houses them in the tin
    Orphans Shack, crawling with toe-biting crabs and dripping with
    a mysterious tan fungus. A beam of light shines through the
    despair when the Baudelaires meet the Quagmires, two of three
    orphaned triplets who are no strangers to disaster and
    sympathize with their predicament. When Count Olaf appears on
    the scene disguised as Coach Genghis (covering his monobrow
    with a turban and his ankle tattoo with expensive running
    shoes), the Quagmires resolve to come to the aid of their new
    friends. Sadly, this proves to be a hideous mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snicket disarms us again with his playful
    juxtapositions--only he can compare bombs with strawberry
    shortcake (both are as dangerous to make as assumptions), muse
    on how babies adjust developmentally to the idea of curtains,
    or ponder why the Baudelaire orphans would not want to be
    stalks of celery despite their incessant bad luck as humans. We
    can't get enough of this splendid series of misadventures, and
    can only wager that swarms of young readers will be right next
    to us in line for the next installment. (Ages 9 and older) --
