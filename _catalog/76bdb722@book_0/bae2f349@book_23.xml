    <div xmlns="">
      <font class="Apple-style-span" size="2">Fleeing the village
      of VFD, after some time in the Deluxe cell for a murder they
      did not commit, the Baudelaires hide with the Volunteers
      Fighting Disease on their way to the Heimlich Hospital.
      Addressed by Babs, who can only be contacted through an
      intercom speaker on a desk, the orphans start work with the
      near-sighted Hal in the hospital library of records. Hal says
      he remembers a file in the records to do with the Snicket
      fires, but before the children can find it, Babs is suddenly
      replace by Mattathias - none other than Count Olaf - who
      plans to inspect every employee in the hospital. Staying late
      to find the file, the Baudelaires find a picture of their
      parents with Jacques Snicket, and another, partly obscured
      figure who may be a writer. But at that moment Esme Squalor
      arrives - Klaus and Sunny escape, but Violet is led to the
      operating theatre for a cranioectomy. Disguising themselves,
      Klaus and Sunny manage to rescue the unconscious Violet, but
      not before Esme has set fire to the library of records,
      adding arson to the false charges now facing the children.
      Chased through the now burning hospital, they make their
      escape, only to discover that the only way out is to hide in
      the trunk of Count Olaf's car - possibly the most dangerous
      place of all.</font>
