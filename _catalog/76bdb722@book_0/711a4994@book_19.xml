      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">This story has a happy ending. No, wait, that was a
    different tape... Dear Customer, If you have picked up this
    sheet, you have probably not read the warning so clearly
    outlined in my prior message. This story may seem cheery at
    first, when the Baudelaire orphans spend time in the company of
    some interesting reptiles and a giddy uncle. But don't be
    fooled. The three siblings endure a car accident, a terrible
    odour, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a large brass reading
    lamp and the reappearance of a person they'd hoped never to see
    again. I have made a solemn vow to present this information to
    the public, but there is nothing stopping you from tearing up
    this paper and pretending you've never heard of this CD. Then
    you can sell something that is less unpleasant. With all due
    respect, Lemony Snicket</p>
