      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        Once the legendary knights of the Gabala defended the nine
      duchies. Their hearts were beautiful; their armor was beyond
      compare. They were greater than princes, more than men.
        <br />
        But they were gone, disappeared through a demon-haunted
      gateway between worlds. Only one held back -- Manannan, whose
      every instinct told him to stay. Now he was the coward
      knight, and in torment.
        <br />
        Murder and black magic beset the land. Rumors
      circulated that the king was enchanted, changed, that his
      soul was dead . . . and that a reign of terror was about to
      begin.
        <br />
        Now Manannan realized he would have to face his darkest
      fears: he had no choice but to ride through that dreaded gate
      and seek out his vanished companions.
        <br />
        And the secret he would learn there would tear his soul
      apart . . . .
        <br />
        "A sharp, distinctive medieval fantasy. Dramatic,
      colorful, taut." -- Locus
